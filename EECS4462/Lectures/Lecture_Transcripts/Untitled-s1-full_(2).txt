Hello again. 
I just finished meetings for week 2 with everybody. 
Glad to see that i must have your progressing. 
Well figuring out what's to send the audio plugin house and all of that. 
If you haven't looked into it yet there's still time to catch up. 
You should be getting started on these things. 
Very fast. 
Now for the next two weeks we will focus on getting ready for a simon one which is due on october 2nd. 
And we'll try the mop with unity of course but our main focus will be on the assignment. 
So i still seeing the material posted. 
There is a just tutorial. 
On icy blood pidgeotto plugin. 
Those are supposed to be assignment so you may have seen it already. 
You can get that to work. 
Then i used to be able to modify the codes and there are 29 the functionality do you need for a samovar. 
I did get a few questions in the party meetings about the code so i will prepare a video. 
Tutorial. 
On how these examples work and what does the code actually do. 
And i'll post it. 
Below this video by tomorrow. 
Now i would like to emphasise that once you look at the video i post then you really have everything you need to do assignment 1. 
There's no need to wait any of the next board meeting or anything like that.
