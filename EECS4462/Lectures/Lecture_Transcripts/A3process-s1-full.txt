Alright so. 
Let's take a look now watch how the processing part of the starter code for a cemetery works. 
Error:
Nicole go there a little bit of interest on how to status kind of dsp processing. 
So just provides a number of. 
Processors that we can use directly. 
And of course. 
Error:
Anyperk american implement their own processor. 
We're going to be doing this in this costco's. 
That mathematical background required is not part of the prerequisites for the course. 
If you taking some signals and systems courses and so on. 
You probably know that is quite. 
Error:
Complicated. 
2. 
To get right. 
Error:
An appointment. 
When we get physically to frequency bass effects right. 
So. 
So far away. 
We're about to do volume bass effects. only multiplying samples. 
Buy some foxer what time base affected moving samples to the left or to the right. 
Error:
Mad when we get to frequency pacific's ball game. 
Error:
We need to take a whole bunch of samples in sequence. 
And extract information from them. 
It's much more complicated. 
So. 
What we'll do is we'll use some of that facilities that just provides. 
To do some of that for us. 
So. 
Any processor that just provides or if you write universe or will have to. 
Actually mad about the grinder face and that. 
Error:
It's called processor base into it's right so you can see. 
Api for each year. 
Basically. 
The three methods repair process and reset any fact. 
Error:
Those do remind us a lot of four would be doing with a plugins. 
It's prepared to play and process block right. 
Error:
And there are so diverse similar. 
But the dsp. 
Mojo love juice. 
Cause i'm slightly differently. 
But the idea is the same. 
We start with the paper method. 
Keep calling the process method. 
With a bunch of samples. 
One of the processor that implements. 
Dippity filter. 
Particular way to implement. 
Error:
Filters on said low pass or high pass filter and so on. 
So complicated. 
For you will tell us.. 
Or. 
The residents water filter. 
Error:
Is it bad to get how the filter. 
Reacts close to the california weather actually amplifies sound like elephants eat so the final hello filters have this resonance so that's why we have it here as well. 
Also there is a set type with ls set it to whether it's a hypothesis low pass away. 
But. 
For sure. 
I will leave them at the fair reset. 
And process. 
Error:
That means it is a processor we can use. 
Either way that was enoch. 
Show me the code then. 
You'll say that. 
My brother said that ate the clare. 
Error:
Available. 
Office type. 
Time. 
That's what i needed to hear. 
Error:
For that part of the filter. 
And that's it will stay in the cold. 
The process take out how we actually use it. 
Now. 
Sometimes we want to. 
Combined another processors right so as we saw in the demo of of the plugin. 
That was a phaser. 
Write a cool change. 
But it was also a gain. 
Affecting only the phaser. 
It's all of a sudden. 
Attached to. 
At the end of the phaser. 
So. 
What we going to do. 
Angels east actually creates pressure chain objects. 
So. 
This is a special class. 
The best cplusplus terminology for this very etiquette class. 
Which is a fancy way to say that. 
You can. 
Create. 
Objective it provide as many other classes as generic argument. 
You like. 
So. 
Cuz i'm blowing out cold air. 
And then as a general. 
I could have only one processor. 
Orilissa processors. 
Cefcu hours i want. 
So here i'm saying i want to create the process of chain. 
And the first processor interchangeable be a phaser. 
As i would be a game processor. 
And i call this affects jane. 
Whatever here. 
And in order to be able to access individual processors from the chain. 
Salon. 
The gladys animation character of. 
Help me find the different this is in that chain. 
So we'll see how that goes.. 
Error:
When we go to the cp4. 
Error:
So persistent then are also preserves themselves will process using the first thing university saying the second that someone writes so as you can see they also have. 
Prepare reset the process methods. 
And what day do we supposed to just north of the prepare resetting process methods of the individual processors. 
Set reminder handy thing to have eternal love. 
Combining different effects together in one chain on fixed. 
The one thing about processor chains is that. 
I'll compile time will fixing exactly what processors will be their undoing world order. 
There's no way for us to. 
2 chainz. 
Error:
But it also is quite fast as with that way. 
Just asking provides a different class called audio processor graph. 
That allows you to create different audio processors. 
And dynamically has run time change the order for these processors and combine them in any way you want that someone. 
So that's a lot more flexible. 
If you need some like this then definitely. 
You have to use another processor graphic need to rearrange the way the processes is happening. 
Error:
But. 
At the same time is not as efficient as. 
These pics are composite so there's a trade up there. 
Between flexibility and efficiency. 
It is a fairly complicated way of creating an audio processor graph and connect a different notice one so whenever i use it. 
For the course. 
But it's good to know it's there. 
We'll just going to use the process of chain director. 
Okay so so have my processes jane you're ready. 
And my individual processor which is the filter. 
Declarative so let's see how we can use them. 
Call processing. 
Know when we go to rcpp we still have to do the same medicine before basically prepare to play and process block they're still there. 
Error:
But now. 
We're basically going to delegate. 
All the processing to the process actually going to play. 
With individual samples anymore like religion assignment 2. 
Anguilla let the processors. 
Error:
Do the forest. 
And of course we'll have to. 
Error:
Set them off to do it correctly. 
Antoine bethea. 
Error:
Things are simple. 
Manipulation is now. 
Delegated to the breast. 
So nice to be able to do that. 
We need to actually give. 
The brothers are all the information. 
So. 
There's a couple things to do in regards to play. 
We are. 
Create semi call the prospect another class in greece. 
Error:
Bsp module. 
Error:
As you can see. 
He basically. 
Contains the sample rate the block size of a number of tiles. 
Enough. 
That we going to use. 
That the process of will need to know when elizabeth processing price of a grade that. 
Prospect. 
Hyundai. 
Error:
Later on. here we going to actually pass. 
The sound. 
Respect to. 
R2. 
Process rights within with filter. 
What is that. 
Combined if you want. 
The composite processor. 
Error:
Am i going to get it now they just two different poses us that we going to use. 
To to effect their audio. 
Error:
Error:
So we give them. 
Respect physically sampleraid number. 
Refresh a big block. 
I also we. 
Call larry said method provide to. 
Initialize. 
If you want so. 
Error:
That's good any time. 
View soto. 
Found that you finished processing a clean slate to. 
Alright so that's very simple setup here we just get ready. 
And why do of course before i move on. 
Grab any values from the gooey. 
To make sure that they're all set up correctly. 
So this update effects method. 
Apartment values of the beginning. 
The. 
No will you respond to. 
Customized our processors so they do that process that we want. 
So. 
For example if you remember that, bucks for the filter then based on the filter choice. 
Which is. 
One of the pioneers. 
What selection is made in a combo box selection. 
I'm amazed. 
Error:
I will use the set type method of my. 
Filter. 
Price of my processor this kind of processor provided set timer.. 
And. 
I'll set the type to this big long name. 
Which makes it look worse.. 
Simulator for bumpass high pass. 
Antifa. 
It's always is to have the filter off then i just. 
Update my bypass. 
Variable to be true. 
And we'll see that that's the case then of saying no processing will take place. 
Error:
Also. 
If the slider has moved. 
Then. 
Error:
I got this. 
Perimeter volume. 
And i use the set cuddle frequency method of the processor. 
To do that. 
You get the idea. 
Error:
I drop am from the goalie. 
I use the api of the processors that i'm using to set them up correctly. 
So that when i go to rustic luck they will do the processing that i want. 
For the phaser right i can turn it on and off. 
It's a little bit different in terms of how do we access individual processor in the process or chain. 
Those days. 
Interesting. 
A line of code here so i can suppressor. 
Is the temperature. 
Error:
I suppose fast that says well from. 
The generic for am. 
I'll be hot in the duration of effects jane writes a book about 28. 
This is the first barometer. 
Error:
Vase. 
Give me the 18 position gain index. 
This is why i'm hot. 
And i'm here. 
So i know that the gaming decks is the second one. 
So just give me a second. 
Processor. 
Error:
And then i'm going to shut off story than this. 
Babel. 
Almost don't care what time it is. 
Hobbit. 
Error:
Use they said gambino. 
Methadone. 
To change the game. 
Rancifer go to. 
The game processor. 
Maybe i'll go see that that this is america. 
Mine of course. 
We expect that this would be the right type if we mixed something up and this is not a game processor. 
Then neither on timer. 
Wrightsville. 
Error:
As many cases with audio processing. 
We don't tick types. 
We assume you'll be done correctly. 
Because it's much faster. 
Error:
Error:
Phazer kraze so we get. 
The fazer index and get the fascia processor care and then. 
If we look at the phaser api. 
Right there is methods of separating the depth is alabama to helen ugly also so i can do that. 
Here. 
Is actually a lot more time is there. 
What to use for the demo. 
And that's it so this method basically grabs the promoters. 
From the goalie updates. 
The processor by using mattresses asset return. 
So that when we tell them we cannot process that will do the processing that we want. 
Listen to look at israeli process block. 
Pretty small. 
In fact. 
Error:
Stop hours does boilerplate code from juice that we always leave there in never touch. 
So my code is 25 lines of code. 
Right so. 
Using process service. 
Makes things a lot easier. 
Innocence. 
Hey so frightened of the ways of course every time process block is called. 
I texted you that you survived moving around. 
Sliders on sale on sawyer i always update. 
Error:
Myfex always get the parameter values. 
Error:
Call the right matheson processors to change the way they are processing that's why as your sewing the demo. 
Acuvue have this song playing and i can be moving around it. 
Configure cnn. 
The sound transit real-time that's because every few milliseconds. 
Is it called the process of updating grabbing the new prime devalue and i'm taking the processors. 
I'm getting different effects. 
Okay some of the processor. 
And i wanted to say is okay to the processor. 
So don't hear it. 
Have my suppressors going to call the process method for each one of them write ups lee. 
I call it. 
Error:
In this particular order. 
Different. 
Error:
I have my book a message to say i think is off then don't make a call. 
Write 7. 
It was a rough then actually not even happen. 
Which is fine. 
Error:
What do i give this processor and what they expect these actually. 
Error:
Process context. 
And process context is basically. 
Kind of like no your buffer. 
Error:
Juicing the dsp mojo uses a different. 
Start recording audio blog and. 
From what i read is basically.. 
A lighter container for the samples. 
It does not locate any memories of his references to the saint paul saints pass it around much easier and faster. 
Error:
But. 
For all. 
Error:
We have to worry about his colour is basically all day. 
And you can see that. 
Yeah i'm declaring another clock. 
Initializing it by giving you the audio buffer. 
Price of oil. 
This other block refers to the other boyfriend i just got. 
Error:
And then i create a process context. 
Error:
Initialize it without audio block. 
That is. 
The way i think of structured. 
The wages expected. 
I really all i'm saying is think about her. 
Rub it in an envelope containing a converse and then give it to the processor. 
And i'm processors will do the processing that way that would set them up. 
Right celestica i guess process contacts replacing means that. 
The way things will be set up. 
Error:
The input audio block will be also the output on your dog to the apple to replace the input. 
You can also have separate ones with no replacing. 
Bedtime. 
What would happen i need it for for this assignment. 
Okay. 
And that's it. 
Now. 
All the processing gets delegated to the fosters. 
And of course apostasy. 
Gets changed my damn and then i use it. 
This will affect. 
The result that comes out of the process book. 
Error:
Okay that's basically it so your job. 
From here. 
Is a course to. 
Use appositive in processors to do a cemetery. 
Cephalic complicated setup. 
You should be able to. 
Error:
Get started early space don't know this information care. 
1 quake. 
Notice that. 
There's a reverb. 
Presto dentist. 
Alright so. 
That's for spartacus. 
Error:
About time. 
We get to some of that more advanced stuff. 
Error:
Next. 
Okay. 
That's it for now. 
So that suit have a full explanation. 
All-father starter code. 
Error:
473. 
So. 
Come back next week on the pods with your questions for us make sure you study. 
Error:
Will answer all those freshly questions. 
And the next week we'll talk about. 
Error:
Bellator parts. 
Error:
Error:
