Hello everybody. 
I just finished the appointments for week 10. 
Lots of interesting discussion there. 
What's up you have started on assignment for some extent. 
If you haven't don't weigh. 
287. 
Good amount of work is always battlestar this time that first step for something for is to find a game to work with. 
And while it's going to be a fun process can take a long time. 
So i'll make sure to do that this week so you ready to get started on the actual assignment tasks. 
Also know that i have moved i deadline for 7:40 tuesday december 8th. 
So that you have the full three weeks to complete it. 
Now before we get into the material for this week make sure the complete your peer feedback for assignments three. 
Before the deadline on sunday night. 
Same deal as last time i'll make sure to provide photo and detailed feedback. 
Incorrect feedback. 
Based on the rubric. 
No i just said if you haven't looked at that your peer. 
Submissions to do that as soon as possible. 
Still at least know that you can compel them. 
Without problem. 
Error:
A father's this is without a doubt it'll be too late. 
Fix those on sunday make sure you at least look at them today or tomorrow. 
Now the nexus material is a whole bunch of videos to watch and a few sections of the unity manual to read. 
That will give you everything you need to do a salmon for. 
Matilda study all their material carefully. 
And come to the next pods. 
Questions. 
Now i would pass the rubric and a submission link for a 74 with the next couple days. 
So you'll have that information as well. 
Note that part of yourself decent would be a plain text description of how you satisfy the requirements of the assignment. 
Especially talas. 
Error:
What to do in the game to be able to see the different river bc have or to see changing music and things like that. 
So you might want to be right in that house you work on your project. 
Other than that. 
Good luck with unity. 
And i'll see you next week.
