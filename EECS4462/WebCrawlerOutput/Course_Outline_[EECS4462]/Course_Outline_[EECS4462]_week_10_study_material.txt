Week 10 (to be completed by Thursday, November 19)Study material
Our next target is to learn about audio in video games.
Start by studying the slides on Game Audio. They describe the process for audio in large video games, so they won't necessarily apply to Assignment 4.
Continue with our Weekly Unity Background: Complete Section 9. Adding Audio.
Finally, study Assignment 4 (click on the Sidebar to find it) and choose a game to work with. Look for sound files that you will use for A4 online. Places to look into:
