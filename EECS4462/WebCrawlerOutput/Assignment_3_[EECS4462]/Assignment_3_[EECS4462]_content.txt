Providing audio input to your plugin
You can use the Audio Plugin Host to create MIDI events that are turned into audio by the Sine Wave Synth plugin as before, or use the VSTAudioPlayer plugin (see Week 7 material). The footsteps.wav file linked above may come in handy.
Debugging your plugin
Debugging an audio plugin works in the same way as for a MIDI plugin, so refer to Assignment 1 for debugging help.
