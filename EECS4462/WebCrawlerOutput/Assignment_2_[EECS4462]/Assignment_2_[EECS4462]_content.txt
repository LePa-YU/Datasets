Providing audio input to your plugin
You can use the Audio Plugin Host to create MIDI events that are turned into audio by the Sine Wave Synth plugin. You can then route the output of the Sine Wave Synth to the input of your plugin.
Debugging your plugin
Debugging an audio plugin works in the same way as for a MIDI plugin, so refer to Assignment 1 for debugging help.
