So welcome everyone you are in the first class meeting for e. c. s. 34 61. I trust that you're all in the right place. If you're a zoom bomber, you shouldn't be here because of the security settings on the zoom. But I don't know if you are don't bomb because it just is very unpleasant for all of us. Uh This is Section A. So I believe most of you, all of you are formally enrolled in Section A. Although in the course announcements we did invite people from section B to attend section and vice versa. So irrespective of your section. Welcome. Today's class meeting will be brief. Our goal is to get the course launched and start with the course material sustainably in the next uh class meetings. So just to begin with all of the course materials you'll see this intellectual property notice. So this is just affirming the creative work creators right to retain copyright and reminding everyone that it's not okay for you to record this lecture and to post it and that we will post the recordings and they're available in the E. Class site and so on and so forth. Also it's very important that we take a moment to reflect who we are where we're in place and what we're doing and to understand that what we're doing is part of a larger context. So with that I'd like to begin all courses with a land acknowledgment and to acknowledge that this meeting is taking place online and because of that we're not all actually gathered in the same physical space and york's land agreement land acknowledgment is predicated on certain assumptions of place, namely that we're all gathered on the york campus, which that doesn't necessarily hold. So I ask each of you to take the responsibility to think about the territory that you're on. If you're physically in Canada right now and I know not all of you are, I'm asking you two if you're in Canada to not assume that your unseated land, not on land in Canada is seated. Um Some most land is subject to territory to treaties. But if you are on a treaty territory, a city territory like take a moment to identify who the current treaty boulders are and to acknowledge them. And if you're outside of Canada, you can reflect on the concept of colonial colonialism and that Canada is built as a colonial nation and what that means for you. So as a faculty member, instructor of this course and a member of your university community, I recognize that many indigenous nations have longstanding relationships upon which with the territories upon which your university is located. And these relationships precede the establishment of york university. They precede york University by several hundreds of years. We acknowledge our presence on the traditional territory of many indigenous nations. The area known as to Toronto has been care taken by the National Bank nation, the hotel Nocioni Confederacy, the huron when debt and then 80 it is now home to many indigenous peoples. We acknowledge the current treaty holders. The Mississauga of the credit First Nation. This territory is subject of the dish with one poon spoon wampum belt covenant, an agreement to peaceably share and care for the Great Lakes region and a wampum belt government government is in agreement and this agreement was entered into by various parties, all of which predate first contact and colonialism. So there's a little history lesson that you may or may not already be familiar with. So let's get started. Uh first let's get us going with the teaching team. So we're gonna begin with instructor introductions and we're just going to briefly introduce ourselves and say like one sentence about each other. And I am totally going to put my co instructor on the spot because I put her name first. So with that I'm going to turn the floor over to my co instructor. Thank you. Hi everyone welcome to this course. I hope we have a great senator together and we learn all from each other.

SPEAKER 2
My name is man acoustics are there And as you

SPEAKER 0
probably know if the videos are up, I don't know,

SPEAKER 2
I'm a master student and in my and I am in my third year I am studying computer science and

SPEAKER 0
I will be graduating probably the next month. Um, so during my masters that studies, I've been working

SPEAKER 2
on human computer interaction and more specifically uh design of

SPEAKER 0
assistant technology devices. Um and feel free to ask any questions from me if you want and if not get back to you. Thanks very much and is very modest and humble to not mention that she has a tremendous amount of experience as a tia and leader of this course for several terms back. So um she's a very experienced researcher in this field and we're really, really pleased that the department was able to persuade her to take on this role as teacher. So a warm welcome to her and we're really happy and it's it's going to be really a great term I think. So my name is Melanie Balco. I am a professor here in the Department of Electrical Engineering Computer Science. I have taught this course many times, I lost count, but it's more than 10 and um it feels like it's a new course every time because in general I try to change uh the course and improve it based on the feedback I received and also based on the field, the field has changed tremendously over the last period of time, even from year to year. So this is of course that needs to be constantly updated um briefly about myself, I'm a research faculty member, which means I split my time between research and teaching and I am the director of a research lab that has many students from different degree programs. Um It's an interdisciplinary lab that combines computer science, digital media, critical disability studies, um science and technology studies and uh let's just leave it at that. So it's it's a place where we do work that brings together lots of types of knowledge and in fact, we just questioned the whole construct of a discipline and try to look more broadly at human practice and and being so uh we will get the chance to learn more about the different research projects in my lab because I often use them to illustrate points in the course. So moving on, we have a team of three or 4 to use in this course. They're very, very important and we are still settling down the ta assignments. So we're going to introduce those TVs in the class in the next classes. But please have a look on the course website and we have the team teaching tab and the names are provisionally there and we are going to put little videos up. It's in progress. Um, so that people who are here can see my face and Mona's face again and the T. A. S. Or if you are not in this class and listening to the video afterwards. You can also go and look at the team teaching link on the course website about you, the students. I really wish that we were somehow arranged in a way. So I could open the floor and get to know everyone and you know, pull people. But Because of COVID-19 were in this remote delivery format and we're using Zoom. So I have this kind of uh computer mediated platform. It's got its pros, it's got its cons, but definitely one of the cons is only one row of my display of participants actually shows like a human face and everyone else is like either a black tile or some people have photos or someone has Pepe, which is provoking. Um so I'm just looking through. So anyway, um, welcome to all of you. I look forward to getting to know you if I could, I would go around and everyone introduce themselves, but we would use up all our time. So we're going to save that for a bit later when we're in a smaller group format. Um we looked at the course enrollment in advance of this meeting and there are more than 200 students in section A&B combined, closer to 220, most of you are in what's called level three. So when we come to enrolment, we use level 1234 as opposed to year 1234 because the student, for instance, can be in their first year, but actually have a lot of transfer credits. So making them like for instance, a level three students And um student might be in their second year but has only completed, let's say 12 credits. So they're actually technically level one. So the level of study is determined by the number of credits you've completed and most of you are completed a number of credits commensurate with three years of study. I don't mean to be normative because there's all kinds of paths and university, not everyone is taking full time classes and powering through people have lives that mean that they do part time for a term. They take a term off, they have to take a year off they work and they can't take a full course load whatever. So, you know, I'm not making any assumptions about the kinds of folks who were in the class because there's a lot of diversity and that's perfectly okay. Um about 60% of the students are in a bachelor of science program And about 35% or in a bachelor of arts programs. And there is about five students who are from other types of degrees. So the type of degree like BSE or be A does not determine your program of study. That actually is the third bullet point. So about 75% of you, our computer science students. But as you hopefully are aware to do a computer science degree in the Lasagne School of Engineering. You can do it either as a B. A. Or is a B sc. And about 20% of the students. Sorry, I have notifications popping up About 20% of the students are in the digital media program, which is only a b. A program. There is not a BSC version and about 5% of their classes from other degree programs. There's a few people here from cognitive science, business and society. I don't know if anyone is from a fairly exotic program, put it in the chat so we can see you because I'm always interested to see what kind of students come into the course. This is a quasi required course for the computer science and digital media programs quasi required in the sense that students must take three of a list of four courses and this course is on that list of four. So that's a little bit about what we know of you. Um, but I don't know, I won't yet have the chance to meet each of you. So I don't yet know you as like human beings. So please forgive this kind of rough overview and well, we'll get to know each other more over the course. Uh, let's keep going here. So here's the official course description from the register's office, just so we're all on the same page. So this course introduces user interfaces and the tools and mechanisms to create and prototype them. Students work in small groups and learn how to design user interface is how to realize them and how to evaluate the end result. And I can say with confidence that this description was written 20 years ago, it's still basically okay. But you know, in the intervening years we now have a more nuanced understanding of what constitutes these are interface, The platforms that have interfaces have changed vastly. The mechanisms for creating and prototyping them have changed vastly and um how how interfaces get realized and the practices that are involved have also changed. So the course has been modified to keep up with these things. Here are the what are called uh course learning outcomes and it's a way to articulate the things that should be accomplished by the end of the course. So if the teaching team is successful by the end of this term, you will be able to explain the capabilities of both humans and computers from a socio technical system perspective. So this includes human information processing module but not exclusively. There's various models that we use to frame out and to conceive about humans and computers come into contact with each other and how they interact at the end of the course, you should be able to describe and critically evaluate typical human computer or HD model styles and paradigms. Now, what is the paradigm? What is a mild all what is the style all of this? We're going to sort out these things all have specific meanings. You should be able to apply an interactive design process and universal design principles to designing HD system. Okay, so what is an HD system? We have to sort that out? What is an interactive design process? The particular design process we're going to use is something called user centered design. This stands in contrast with technology center design, which is the umbrella term for the methods you might be familiar with from software engineering if any of you are taking 33, 11 or even in the intro sequence of courses and you're learning how to design software. That is a design methodology just like you know, any other design methodology but that's what's called a technology centered design approach. Universal design principles in Cielo three course learning outcome three get flagged as particularly important but just note that This is a set of principles just like the other principles that we're going to talk about under # two. Mhm Oh sorry under # four which is described and apply Hcea design principles, standards and guidelines. So part of this is going to sort out what's the difference between a principal and a standard and guidelines. What are the meanings of all these like nomenclature that we're introducing? five, analyze, identify and critically evaluate user models, user support, socio organizational issues whatever that refers to. Will identify that and stakeholder requirements of HD systems and last but not least analyze, discuss and critically evaluate each. See issues in various application domains for example, group were ubiquitous computing, virtual reality, multimedia and web based applications. The age of the description is showing itself multimedia like we don't talk about systems in those terms so much these days. The normal player has kind of moved on. So I don't think we're going to be able to do all of these in super great death, but we're definitely going to hone in on one or two in more detail and talk about the others, but not to the same extent. So that's like a lot right? Like ask yourself at the end of the course, if you can do all of these things, that's like a pretty impressive achievement. So we're here to like support you so you can accomplish this at the end. I like the course learning outcome format because it makes it action oriented. Like when we're doing assessment, we're not just cooking up like test questions out of the blue, everything is mobilised towards showing that you've mastered these skills and these competencies. Okay, so this come to the part of the presentation where we say like how does this course work? How does it operate? And I came to realize that there is the way I want to describe how the course is designed, but that's not the same as how like you, the students who are assembled here, how you want to hear it described and the problem is that there's a tension between these two things and I like normally would describe the course and like a fairly high level fashion and you know why we're doing it and how it's all set up, but then students are just frustrated. Like tell me the thing I want to know up front, so I decided, let's just do that because you know, it's better design. Um Okay let me just deal with something. Okay so I received a request to enable live transcript so I turned it on and I have to admit I didn't anticipate the needs so it's kind of on the fly thing. Hopefully it's going to function well. Cool. Okay it's a little bit distracting because I can see it transcribing as I speak, complete with the errors so it's just just come down but discombobulating but I'm going to try and ignore it. So as I was saying we're just going to first start with what I think are the elements you want to hear about, So let's just do that. Okay, what I think you want to hear number one, there's no final exam students always want to know is their final exam. This course does not have a final exam, This course has 10 modules, they get marked and they're worth 10% each. The modules are approximately a week long. Now there's 13 weeks in the course and 10 modules, so clearly these things do not map 1 to 1, so that's why it's approximately, oh thank you, Amir is telling me I can hide the transcript. Maybe I want to try and do that. Mhm. But I don't have time to figure out how to do it hide some potato. Mhm. Okay thank you, I hit it on my own screen. Uh So what happens in each module, there's a bunch of graded activities and the particular activities depend on the module. Usually there's a quiz a little 112234% depends on the size of the material assignments that you complete. You do some of them individually, some of them are group work, you do pieces that are part of a larger project, so a project gets completed, but each module advances a certain piece of the project. There are exercise sets, particularly at the start of the course where we're still learning the fundamentals, we have a lot of exercise sets and critiques. You will critique systems, you will provide critiques of other student work in a respectful and atomized form. But part of this course is being able to assess and adjudicate using principles and guidelines and so on. So you have to practice that. So we asked you to prepare critiques and like I said, some of these things are done individually, some of them are done in groups. Now I'm going to talk about it in a kind of longer detailed way. So as I said, we have all these things that get graded, but we're not grading you just to come up with a grade. We need to assess the degree to which you've mastered the course learning outcomes. So there is a design towards the assessment pieces in general, we are expecting nine hours per student of work per week per student and I think it's really important for all of course instructors to say this upfront. So this is following the ratio of 2-1 for every one hour in class meetings usually be spending two hours outside of the class. This is a general heuristic that's used in university courses, in my experience, this course sticks to this pretty well, but it can be bursty one week might be more another way. We can maybe less. I think personally, if it were up to me all courses would follow this, but I happen to know from talking to folks that some courses do not respect this and some courses are infamous for being just like hugely time demanding and although that's not super great, it's okay if at least it's signaled in advance so you can organize your lives and figure out a schedule that works for you. So in general, I'm expecting nine hours of work from you and that includes three hours every week spent in these in class meetings. Okay, So we have these modules, I've mentioned one per week. So the goal of the modules is as the name suggests, module, authorization, we like package the learning into these units that are coherent by theme to the extent that we can do this. So each module has graded activities and the idea is that um oh and there might be other activities that you need to do, support your learning, but they're not graded, but you do them anyways because you're motivated and you want to learn And then all the activities for the module get graded and then you get a module mark. So at the end you're going to have 10 marks, one per module. The course grade is based on each of these modules, final exam. Um I hope the module of the sprint, sorry, that's a bit of word salad there, there were 10% each at the start of each module we have. We need to sometimes adjust the composition of the modules depending on how the courses going. So we generally release all the detailed information at the beginning with advance notice so that you can do the prep work. Um, so that is going to happen. The course website does not have the content fully populated yet because we're just getting that settled. But rest assured it will be put up in advance of when you need it. What else did I want to say? Maybe just briefly that there is no final exam and the quizzes are not in vigil ated using Proctor track or any of these surveillance technologies. This course does not use that. I am ideologically opposed to Proctor track. This course does use the flip classroom, which means that you we don't use our class time for me or Madonna to be a talking head to just tell you a bunch of stuff Because frankly that's not a good use of our time together. We have only 24 hours of contact with with one another. So it makes more sense to use that time for you to be doing things and to receive feedback and you know, to to to apply your knowledge and to do problem solving and task. So you discourse ask you to view the prerecorded lectures in advance, There are readings for sometimes. So these are called resource packs. There might be articles, you're going to get those before the start of the module and it's expected you come to class having read all of these things or watch the videos, so we're going to use the time in class for active learning. This this class is not an example of that because it's not active, you're just sitting listening and I'm doing all the talking. So like I acknowledge the irony of the situation, but after we get the intro out of the way we're going to, when we come together, we're gonna be doing active tasks, we're gonna be working on things. So the whole classes attending and what we do in our class meetings is going to depend on the module. So the next couple slides trace out some of the things we're going to be doing during class. So discussions, we're going to have a lot of those, So we're going to discuss the material, the lecture, answer questions, I might pose a provocation, see how you respond. Sometimes I can post a like a way for you to respond to the provocation and then you fill it out and it might be worth like 1% of the grades, something like that. We're going to record the discussions, um they'll be posted afterwards. But really if you're not here, you kind of missed out on the opportunity to um participate. And the syllabus does state that you are required to attend class. It's unstructured and usually grades are not assigned, although if there is like a response piece, there might be a small percentage for that. Uh then there will be class activities that are formally led. So here's the structure activity. Now we do this, everyone does it now we do this. So it's structured um they won't be the whole class time. Usually shorter burst. People need to take a break and so on. They're going to be directly guided either by us, the instructors manner or myself or the T. A. S. It's going to take place during class. Sometimes we allow a little bit of time after class to clean up your submissions and to get them submitted. So usually after class. Um So this, yeah, okay, let me stop on that. These are grouped based or individual and they're not worth a lot, but they are worth like one or 2% of um of the grade. So at the module modules or 10%, there might be a few in class activities worth a couple of percentage. Then there is more like independent activities that the students are doing and the T. A. S. And the instructors are standing by for support so you will go into your breakout rooms you'll do your thing. Some people use rooms in discord whatever and we're here to support you so you put up your hand and we come in and we answer your questions or we help you troubleshoot a thing. Um These things are usually bigger and they're worth more. So it depends on the nature of the activity. The class time is a protected time. We know that you're all like in principle free during that class time. So if there's a group work then this is like a protected time that we know the group can work together and we just make that assumption and plan of course accordingly. So that in summary are the main types of activities we're going to be doing during class outside of class. Like in addition to the prep work the quizzes I usually don't use class time for the quizzes. Those are mounted afterwards. The reason I think that it doesn't make sense to do them in class is this is not a time based kind of competency. So in general you should be able to finish the quizzes within like 15 2030 minutes. Um Because we're all different and some of us take more time than others to do things. I'm fine with that. I don't think it like Is part of the course learning outcomes to do that list of five things and to do them fast. So like if students need more time to get the quiz done, I put here 16 minutes. But On occasion I usually double triple quadruple that. So you know you have a 24 hour period. You have to complete the quiz within that 24 hour window. But when you open it you have like you know a certain amount of time to get it done and it's really really richly provisions and I love seeing the applause that's positive feedback tells us that we're doing something right. Uh So that's about the quizzes and it's the honor system. My friends like I we have no way to prove that you're not like on the phone with your friend getting the answers fed to you. So we ask you to do the quiz individually and to use the materials that are permitted. So usually you can use all the recordings, you can use the the resource packed, you can use whatever. This is not a test of memory. This is a test of your knowledge uptake. But you know the honor system is in place. The quiz is usually are not worth more than 20% of the whole course across all the modules. So you know there's 10 modules, maybe two, maybe 3% of the module grade will be a quiz. So the value is kept, the weight is kept low. So that's the quiz. Okay. Group work. Group work is like uh how many people have good experiences with group work? You don't have a good way to give me feedback. Some people. Yes. Good. A lot of people. I see tears. Yeah, 50 50. It's it's a sticky thing, right? Group work when it's like running well, it's like awesome, but it can be like the worst of the worst. So, so uh without getting into like the specifics, because we use all kinds of groups in this course. At the beginning, we have like groups of 15 if you can believe it, and then groups of five groups of three groups of two. So lots of groups. Because being able to demonstrate the course, learning outcomes that you can apply a design process means that you have to be able to function in a group setting. You have to be able to be part of a team. Yeah, so there's a lot of variation in people's experiences. So, because of this, I really believe in the proverb. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. I don't know if you've heard this. So, we use a framework, we're really careful at the beginning about how these things are set up and then that helps prevent problems before they occur. Okay, so how the groups get formed, you people don't know each other in this course, so we're not asking you to form your own groups, we will form the groups at the beginning later on in the course once you get a chance to know each other, You have the chance to form your own groups, but not at the beginning. So we're going to put you in groups at the beginning, everyone gets put into a really big group called the pod. So everyone in the course is going to have a pod. Your pod is the size of 15, it's your local community. These are your peeps. For the beginning of the course, You're going to go into breakout rooms in your pod and you're going to work within the pod. It's not possible for a person in this class to get to know all 219 other people unfortunately, although we would like that. But if you know 15 people, that's like a solid start on things. So that's how we like handle that. It's it's a way to make a smaller goal that's achievable. I have all these notifications popping up, I hope you can't see them. I'm dismissing them as we're talking. Uh so that's basically how it's going to happen now. You might have a friend and you're in Section A and the friends in section B and you want to work together and can you do this? So can we just like leave all of the cross section logistics later. I think we're going to have an approach that makes everyone happy, but we can't deploy it yet. So for now, stick in your section and you know, we'll come up with a flexible approach later on, Effective group work practices. This is something that, like dawned on me, we have students to work in groups all the time. About 90% of the groups. Well, Let's say 72% of the groups are like really good, 20% are like, okay, Fine medium. And then about 10% of the groups like utterly fail like this, just disaster and why does this happen? And the groups that do okay, like are they doing as good as they could so on and so forth. We don't spend in university very much time teaching students how to work in groups explicitly. So we're gonna do that in this course and just be more clear. And we also have a framework called the framework that lets groups report on their health. So this is not tattling on your group mates. This is answering a series of questions that let us see of all the groups, what's their health, Are they functioning well? Are there problems and how do we intervene and fix problems while they're still flexible before the group totally breaks up. Okay, academic integrity, especially plagiarism. So plagiarism is the situation where you have a group of four and three of the four people do all the work and the fourth person's name gets added on the deliverable. That's plagiarism, that fourth person is saying, I did this work, but they didn't they're taking someone else's work and there, making it look like their own. So technically like according to the academic honesty policy, that situation is plagiarism and it's just not cool, right? It's not fair. So we don't want that to happen and we have some techniques to avoid this from happening and recourse so that students who are in groups who don't contribute, don't get grades, but more importantly, if you are doing work and you are a contributor, you want to see your work recognized right and you want to receive credit for the work you did collectively. So that's, you know, part of being equitable to have like a clear policy up front and then, you know, there's academic integrity, but there's also fairness. So this is not like violation of academic policy, but just like fair can mean just like, do we all have the same idea of the expectations? So if for instance, one group member expects like a certain degree of polish nous for a piece of writing and the other group member thought like I thought I was just creating a draft, so there's like, you know, the possibility of a conflict there, but it's just like a lack of common understanding. So it's not fair if we don't all have the same understanding of what is required and what should be done. Okay, so the size of the configuration of the groups will vary over the term. Like I said, from big groups, 15 pods to smaller groups to begin with, you will form the smaller groups within your pod, but by the end of the course, you can, if you like, form a group, like outside of your pod and you're going to get the chance to work with different people. And I think by and large you're going to have really good experiences. You know, past experience says that there are cases where maybe the experience won't be great, but like I said, we have this good framework and we can catch those things early and intervene so that the impact is minimized. Everyone in the course has a right to have a fair shake at being in a group and to do the group work. So, you know, the person who you think is the slacker from their perspective, they might they might have a different situation, you know, there might be a reason why they conducted themselves the way they have and, you know, there's two sides to every story and that person has a right to be in a group too. So I'm just anticipating this idea that people have about like, let's just kick person out. You can't kick him out. They have to go to a group, right? So we have to find a way for all of us to do the course together. There's a question and answer period at the end. So I think some of you might have questions about this. So we'll get to that at the end of the presentation. What is the time? 1045? Okay, so learning pods, I've already talked about them. You have been randomly assigned. Will be posted in time for the monday class and when we come back here on monday, you're going to go into your pod in a breakout room. Oh we got to the end already so um I can keep talking but I think this is a good point for us to pause and you can ask questions. You can ask questions in the discord channel info discussion or here in the chat or even better. Just put up your hand and then I can call on you and you can open your mic and s the question like allowed. So I'm opening the floor questions, comments, feedback. You don't have to ask a question. You can just make a comment or provide feedback if you like as well. Not. Oh, okay, I see him. Please go ahead. Yes, I'm I'm not hearing you. You're a muted. Is your mic plugged in? Can you, can you hear me now? Yeah, it's good. Go ahead.

SPEAKER 1
Okay. Yes, good morning Professor. Sorry. This question has already been asked.

SPEAKER 0
I just came to the lecture the late, are there any things that we have to do this week that

SPEAKER 1
will be marked in the modules.

SPEAKER 0
So it's a good question. Let me repeat it in case um someone didn't catch the entirety of it. So the question is whether there is any prep work needed for the modules, am I understand you correctly specifically for this week? For this week. So this week is a half week because we have class meeting today, Section B has the meeting on friday. So nothing is due this week. Um, so, and even next week, right? Like what are we going to do? The, you don't have prep work to do like today. You don't have anything available today to get ready for monday. So we're going to just be a bit more gentle at the beginning to take into account that we're in a startup mode. So there will be things next week, but it's going to be done in a way so that you can do them without having received the materials well in advance in general. I think it's really important that things are fair. So for asking you to like read a thing, you should get it like, you know, not the night before the class. You know, we can't give you everything all up front, but we're going to give it to you like, you know, staged out. So I hope that answers your question. You're all cool here. Also, there's no textbook that you need to buy. You can buy it if you want, but frankly I wouldn't, it's like ridiculously expensive and to be honest, I don't think it's worth the money and it's available in the library, you can easily get it there and not that I'm officially going to sanction this, but rumor has it. If you do a search, you can find the pdf. I don't know. I would never condone illegal activities. But sometimes that does happen I've heard. So you don't need to buy anything. Alright. I didn't hear that from you. Thanks. Yeah, Good. I'm glad. Okay, Jeff, you have a question?

SPEAKER 1
Uh Yeah, so My question is um so that echo 30 33 60.

SPEAKER 0
When will that be?

SPEAKER 1
Live and be? I can be able to see it.

SPEAKER 0
It's a good question. I have the same. So the question is one is Echo360 gonna go live And I have the same question to And I asked our tech team, hello, the term has started, can echo 3 60 you know, please be fixed and they're fixing it. So there's some technical issue with the link between the course and the Echo 3 60. I didn't check this morning, but you know, just stay tuned and it has to get fixed. I don't know. What are you seeing when you go there forbidden? Yeah, four or three error. I get the same thing. I thought I had the wrong email. Like I had it connected to my gmail rather than

SPEAKER 1
my york. You why?

SPEAKER 0
Oh, I don't know about that. But you have a functioning okay for other courses or other courses it works. Yeah. So no, this of course the course emerged. Section A and B together and at that merging point, Echo360 broke. So we're just getting them to fix it. Okay. No problem at all. Other questions. Mm hmm. Okay, let's see here. So, the question in the chat is saying are the class activities both on Mondays and Wednesday. So let's just be careful here because it can get complicated. There are two sections for this course, Section A and B. Section A has class meetings on Mondays and Wednesdays and section B has meetings on Mondays and Fridays. So we're starting in the middle of a week. So section they will meet on Wednesday, section B will meet on Friday. Section B is going to be this same thing again. And then on Monday both sections meet the Section eight from 10 to 11 30 then 11 30 to 1 per section B. So Duke is asking about if there's class activities, both on Mondays and Wednesday. Yes. So every class activity has in classic, every class meeting has class activities and just make sure that you're coming to the right ones. Depending on your section. I think Duke, you're probably asking not so much about what the schedule is, but when we do have class meetings, are we always doing in class activities and the answer to that is yes. Okay. Benedict just asking a question. Mhm. The course syllabus says, sorry, the activity is currently hidden. When will it be unhindered? Um imminently it's being fixed story that we're starting the course with like not so polished website, you know how things are so soon, I'm going to say that and I know that it's hidden and it's like that way on purpose, but Uh it has to get a hidden soon and believe me it would be unhindered by now if it could have been so just stay tuned. The course Syllabus is a monster. It's 14 pages long. It has very detailed course policies about everything and I didn't want to use the class time to go through all of that. It's like possums best. But yeah, when it is posted uh you will have the chance to read it. Okay, let's see here anything else in discord in the chat. Any other questions? No one is asking why the courses from 10 to 11 30 the zoom says 10 to 11 15 and when I'm talking I'm talking about 10 a.m. To 11 20 like all these different times. So let me just take the chance to say um number one Zuma stupid, I cannot make a zoom meeting for an arbitrary amount of time. It has to be in 15 minute increments. So that's why it's one hour, 15 minutes, Number two, the course is Scheduled from 10 to 1130, but academic practices always 90 minute courses are 90 minute classes are 80 minutes long, 10 minutes is allowed. So students can formerly physically go from one place to the other and allow the room to change over and give people a chance to like take a bio break or get a drink of water. And since we moved to this online mode classes like go 90 minutes plus. And it's really, really a problem. It makes students late for their next class. No one gets a break, it's too stressful. Like we just have to like take a moment and say stop this. So this course is, I'm putting from 10 to 11, 15 Is hopefully we finish at 11:15 if we go five minutes more, that's cool. But really, I think it's one of those slippery abuses that happen and we have to stop it because it's really a problem for students. Problem for me too, because you know, I have to talk for a long time. Okay, so uh we have a question from G A qui wang is saying, when will we start to form this group? So the answer to that question is by monday you will have a pod and you're going to work in the pod for the next module, next to modules, and then within the pod, starting in module three or four, you'll form small groups within your pod. So pods of 15, maybe for the first time, you'll be through groups of five and five groups of three. So we'll do it this way. So you don't have to if you're thinking uh it's a stress, I got to like find a group, you know, I gotta make sure I get myself into a good group. Don't think that way. You don't have to form your own group. We're gonna put you in a pod and you're going to work within the pod for the first part of the course, at least until reading week. So reading week is uh between module four and five. So you're all set until then. Okay. And then uh mana, thanks. I missed the question in group work. We have to submit individual answer with different answer other than my other teammates. Am I correct? Where did I totally miss this? Sorry, I'm getting distracted. How did I miss this? Oh yes, way up there. Okay, So I think this question is asking, how is report marked? So what's the basis? So um if I'm understanding correctly, groups will have the choice to complete the work how they want. So sometimes a group will divide the work into pieces and each person does a piece. That's fine. Another approach is a group will say like everyone, let's just make a first rough draft. Each one does it, and then we're going to put them together and refine the unified thing. So there's that kind of approach for group work. But the thing about group work is the group works together produces a piece bigger in scope than any one individual could do working on their own and gets the grade as a group. We have the team health checkup and at that point we find out if the group is not working well and if there's an issue of plagiarism or fairness and then we try to intervene and fix the group dynamic so that that does not perpetuate for the rest of the course or onwards. So I think um that's the question that was being asked. So that was a question from way wade song. Les did I answer your question? I'm not sure if I got it. Exactly correct. Uh Okay. Rohan is asking where would the pre recorded lectures be located, Echo 3 60? Yes, that's that's where they live. Uh Mas is asking will we be making a single submission as a group or we will be will we be allowed to individual submissions in different parts of the group work? So the answer to that is groups submit as a whole. So the group makes a submission, it gets graded and all the members of the group get the grade module. Oh, that whole piece I said about fairness, equity plagiarism, etcetera, etcetera. Other questions. Okay, no one is asking the question, are we doing coding in this course? Does anyone want to ask that question? I don't have to answer it. Yes. So this course used to do implementation Because 15 years ago, 10 years ago, that's how interfaces got prototype, just like the proto to typing tools were kind of crap. So the way to like illustrate the design concept was to actually do like mock up in code and like java abstract renewing toolkit or some of these older technologies technologies have moved right. We have all these different things for doing front and development for building interfaces but more importantly, the whole like landscape of prototyping tools has changed. So this course has changed also. So we're gonna use a lot of prototyping and ideation and design communication tools in this course, like sigma like neuro like storm boards, different things like that. So the field has evolved away from implementing. So this course we'll teach you everything, you know, up up until the point of what's called the design handoff where the design team creates like the prototype functional prototype, mocked up with wire frames and flows. And like in the industry it gets handed off to a deV team that just implements the thing, you know, in code. So we go all the way up until the design handoff and we don't do like the DEV part that's other courses, other learning other course learning outcomes other, it's like a different thing now. Okay, so are we going to be using wire frames or sigma? So that's ken's question, we're going to learn about different kinds of prototypes. Low medium and high fidelity prototypes. We will use stigma to produce the medium and high fidelity prototypes. We will use a variety of tools for the low fidelity prototypes stigma is fine for a low fidelity but other things are also good for low fidelity prototypes. So that's part of the knowledge. And of course like what counts as a prototype? What's the difference between these different types and Colonel is asking? Yes, we're going to use stigma. So one of the modules is really clear on. Here's how you uh sign up for your sigma account. Here's how you get the free educational account. Here's how you work together all of that. So rest assured. If you don't know fig MMA, you don't even know what that is. Don't worry, we're gonna give you everything you need to know. Just take a straw poll. How many people here are familiar and or using sigma? 1 to put, you see um the reactions to give me feedback. Yeah. No. Yes. Okay, so it's about half and half if I'm doing a straw poll. Okay. Yes. Fig mazelike. I think sigma is going to become like what word used to be, where word was like or you know, any like software app, like only specialists knew it. But then gradually it became just like a very basic skill um like using email or using words or using a spreadsheet and I think figure is going to become bad. It's just such a basic tool. There's lots of variants of sigma sigma out there. But you know, we'll talk about that too. And once, you know the skills like for sigma there easily transferable to other prototyping tools? Right, okay, so that's the thing on sigma. Any other questions? Are people excited? Are they looking forward to the term? Okay, that's what we like. Yes, if the thought of the course and this learning outcomes is like, yeah, uh like you're dreading it, that's just not going to make for a very good experience from any of us. But I do understand that some of you are really strapped for courses and you might have, you may be forced to take this course, but this course is like super, Okay, wait here, Yang, yang is how heavy is coding involved? No coding, no software implementation. Uh this uh what was I going to say this course is like design, right? Like you get to build things, you get to think about things you get to analyze. Sometimes I feel that I have to react to criticism which is either said overtly by students or sometimes it's like implicit like why do I have to take this course if I'm like a computer science student, there's no coding involved and to that I have a lot of different answers. But um I guess like in general, uh huh when you have software literacy and you can build things, you have to ask your question yourself the question like why? Like what am I building and why? So how do I reflect on what I'm doing and how do I understand this? Like software artifact out in the world? Like what is it doing? Who is it helping? How are people using it? What impact does it happen? So all of those questions get answered through a framework that is set up in human computer interaction and user direction, design and those like allied fields it's like a cluster of fields and those fields use ways of knowledge, ways of knowing that are not all science scientific method. So this is of course that asked students to stretch beyond maybe what they're used to to consider questions that have not come up before and it's a different kind of experience. So it's great if you're excited because we can do something with that excitement we can build cool stuff. But if you're like crabby about the course like we'll try and do our best but you have to understand what the course is about and we've been really clear about the course. Learning outcomes and our job is to help you master those. Okay let me see here uh look is saying most of our courses don't have coding. That seems strange. Don't you take like 10 11 10 21 or no 10 12 10 22 17 10 17 20. That's all coding. 2011 is coding. 2030 is tons of coding. E. C. S. 2030 is a prerequisite for this course. So that's what I'm thinking about when you're I'm thinking that you're expecting to do coding? Like those courses, ken is saying, will we be using java and java libraries to program or do we plan on using another language? So that was covered in the previous answer where we're not coding, we're going to be prototyping using prototyping tools. Uh, 3101 is solely psychological torment. Yeah, that's analysis of algorithms. Right? So yeah, that's yeah, that's it's part of knowing right to know these like super formal techniques. Theoretic techniques. Okay. I think we're coming to the end of the questions because at this point I'm asking the questions and answering them myself. So I'll just make sure, great. I'm glad to hear where you're excited. Ni Nice. Arc is asking about using adobe, adobe xD. We use stigma and other things. I prefer to use open source, free and open source products whenever possible, stigma is not. Um, but adobe is like particularly kind of refrain from editorializing, but they've adopted a particularly evil model of monetizing their soccer as a service with really expensive monthly subscriptions, closed format. So I try to avoid that for an a university course. It sets the wrong message. It sends people on the wrong path and I don't want to ask you to pay for a big, expensive piece of software when we can get things for free. Okay. So yeah, great questions. Yeah. If there's none, I guess, maybe what I want to point out is, uh, it's a bit of like, right, It's a good message for you, but it's also at the same time admitting fault on my own part, which is I just want to be really upfront to say that I'm really challenged by answering emails. I have good intention but it's really really hard for me to give answers and like a timely fashion. So if you send me an email I'm May want to answer but it's just not going to get answered because I get like 200 email messages a day and I can only spend like a certain number of minutes hours answering emails and then not everything gets answered. So in the past this has been an issue like I'm not just not going to sugarcoat it. So this term we've set up what I hope will be a much better system which is the private virtual office on the website. So please use that option. It's under one on one chat with the instructor. We have a ta who's monitoring that to make sure everything gets answered. So when you post there, the instructors mana and I will see your question, the uh student communication lead is going to monitor and make sure everything gets answered. So I just want to say like I apologize in advance for like not being good on email, it's just like an occupational feature that I can't get all the emails answered. Let ask ask your questions there in the private ritual. Well first asked on discord if it's like low stakes and it's not private because someone's going to answer it really easily. If it's not answerable and discord asking private virtual office. And if it's really like something of personal private matter, like I totally get that. Just say in the private virtual office, like I need to talk with the privately and we'll make it happen, But we just have to triage a bit because it's just overwhelming and when there's more than 200 students in the class, like I can get 200 messages easily just from students like on a daily basis and can't answer them all. Okay, so let's see here how fast is RPC requirement? I don't know. But not particularly like there's no computational heavy apps, everything is in the cloud pretty well. So I don't think that's an issue. If you can run a browser, you're okay. Uh are steep is asking, are there any prerequisites for next lecture? Next monday? No. Uh someone's asking for the discard link and someone is posting it. Thank you, Philip it's from the course website, you can find it there. There is a digital media discord, but that's a server for the program. There's a server specifically for this class one that you can see it. Okay, once this little mind. Okay. So yeah, like just logistically like manna and are here to lead the course, but you folks as a community can really help one another. So that's why the discord servers there. That's why in the chat. I really love it when you answer each other's questions because that just helps us build a good community. Okay, so everyone is joining the discord server. We don't have a bought to automatically turn people from there in initial roll into the student role, but we're going to get everyone like assigned that role and I think we're getting to the end. So last chance for questions. We're going to end at 10:11 Mana. Is there anything that I've forgotten to mention? Um, I saw that someone asked if there's going to be in person activities, but uh, it's so good that you're catching all of these things. Uh, so this course, if we were going to do in person activities, we would have had to make a request way back in May and I didn't back when I was the only one assigned to teach the course. So the answer is no. Do people want in person activities? No, no, no. Yeah, it's a, it's a lose lose situation like solely online kind of sex having in person. Kind of sucks because people are not expecting it. So yeah, the answer to the question is there's no in person activities for this course. If people really wanted it, maybe I could set up like an office our in person or something like that. But that's the most that we're going to be able to handle Philip is asking, does this course focus on aesthetics or is it about the functionality of the design question mark. So this is a provocation and in response I would say what is it about this? Like supposed to dichotomy that people formulate aesthetics and function. So that's what we're going to look at. What is the criteria for assessment and to what extent are these criteria objective or subjective? So we have to define what we mean by aesthetics. Aesthetics does not mean the appearance of things, although that's a common understanding and what is functionality means when we have many interactive systems that are ambient or supportive and they're not task oriented. So functionality means something different in that context. So you'll see this course is going to explode out all of these assumptions we have about like I suppose the dichotomy between this and this or let's say the assumption that all us are part of, you know, the for profit sector. So, you know, this is about unsettling and unseating assumptions and stereotypes that we may have about user interfaces. Yeah, people I know people are not even in Canada home for life. Well that's tragic. Okay, so I think we're kind of started were launched. You know, what's what? And I guess let me go to the next slide what we're done. We've asked and answered a lot of questions, there's lots of chances to still ask and get questions answered and we'll just, you know, there might be prep but if you get it done good if not it's no big deal because we're still in start up mode. So other than that I guess we'll see each other on monday. Cool. All right. Um I'm just gonna linger a little bit in case there's some last little questions but classes done so um feel free to go on to your next thing. Bye.

SPEAKER 1
Hi. Hello.

SPEAKER 0
Hi. Hi.

SPEAKER 1
Um So first I wanted to say I'm really sorry I got here an hour late. Um I got here in time for the Q. And A. Um It's because I for my schedule I only have one class today from eight until 10 11. Um so I didn't know we had a meeting today and then I saw them you know so I rushed in here. Um So that's the first thing is I'm sorry about that. Uh And the second thing is I was wondering if I could request kind of like a super quick summary of the stuff I miss.

SPEAKER 0
Uh That's a tall well a super quick summary will be tough but how about this? This is being recorded And as soon as the Echo 360 link it's fixed, the recorder will be posted so you can watch the recording and you can put it on double speed because I think it's going to be quite long to listen to. So can I just say that instead of attempting to give a summary? Okay.

SPEAKER 1
Yeah that's perfect actually, I didn't think of that. And also just as a little side note, I am really happy that you mentioned just about how adobe is kind of terrible and I'm really glad we're not using it, so thank you for that as well.

SPEAKER 0
Do you agree with that?

SPEAKER 1
Oh, for sure. I've seen like, you know the whole thing of them canceling um accounts of people that are in Venezuela, just because reasons politics, all of that big discussion if you wanted to get into that. But yeah, just like that sort of thing in general. Um the fact that there's stuff like um clip studio paint and affinity designer and all of that and they are just like much more consumer friendly and ethnically better all around. I would say so yeah. Like I'm really glad that I still haven't been forced to use that any adobe stuff in school specifically.

SPEAKER 0
Yeah, it's a way to fight back against the tyranny because it's pretty predatory what they're doing. And I didn't know that they had cancelled accounts or content in Venezuela, Can you say a little bit more about that?

SPEAKER 1
Yeah, it was a while ago. I mean, I just remember, isn't the four times before the pandemic, I just remember that the whole thing, they were like, yeah, um we're just gonna cancel accounts in Venezuela. No refunds either. That's really cool. Um And honestly that's all I remember because it was a long time ago. Yeah, I was just people going, I'm 90% sure you've seen it. There's that, that's really cool graphic that someone made of like, here's some free or one time payment alternatives for adobe software. So there's like Photoshop and then there's like You know, 10 or so programs and they're like, these are free. These ones have like a one time purchase texting. Um and then they're just like I don't know if that's where it originated it, but a lot of that was being shoved around stores really great because people are like, it'll be, is terrible. Just get all the alternatives could be using.

SPEAKER 0
Yeah. So I use Gimp instead of Photoshop and I used to escape instead of, yeah. What is the stupid vector graphic illustrator? I drew a blank. Yeah. And you know, like all XD. I like there's always an alternative and in general, I think common space production, like the open source community is where the innovation is. So like, just personally for for my own practice, I use them. And in the course, I it's like a little opportunity to say like here's what I think we should, we shouldn't use them. Same with textbooks. Like I don't want students to buy textbooks. I think textbook publishers are like predatory as well. And it's just like, it's going to be absolute, so

SPEAKER 1
I don't know if you've heard of it, but I have one class with a professor that I've had before and he published his textbooks. So naturally he's like, if you're in my class you need to buy my book. I'm like I can tell what you're doing. Uh And also I've had uh yeah and I've had some math classes where they say you need to actually sign up for this textbook thing online. Uh And if you do that, you get access to the assignments so you don't have to do it, but you'll get a zero for all the assignments. So it's kind of like what? Why? And the whole thing is terrible. I'm really glad you're cool. Problem that.

SPEAKER 0
Well it's just it creates a barrier because some people are truly strapped. They don't have like extra 80 bucks. So why create a barrier? You should, tuition is expensive enough. We don't. Exactly barriers. Yeah.

SPEAKER 1
Like if anything it should be like included. Like you're already paying a few 100 bucks per course or whatever. So you would think a but most students are surprised

SPEAKER 0
to learn that their tuition only covers one third of the cost to actually deliver the course to them. The government pays the other for domestic students. Many students are not available of that, but how heavily their education is being subsidized by the province. But yeah, so like there's no, okay, then we get into university finances. I agree with you would be nice if it were all included, but I don't see it happening, but we can always hope.

SPEAKER 1
Yeah, I agree. I mean I should know more because I'm a student and I'm into those kinds of politics but like there's there's like lots of countries in europe, I mean I sound extremely vague and non credible right now, but like I've heard that there's lots of countries in europe that just have fully subsidized postsecondary education, so it's kind of like, you know, I don't think they have some magical crystal that makes them be able to do that now. I just think there's something that they're doing that we could do to kind of say we're not doing it

SPEAKER 0
Well it's yeah, it's interesting. So there's countries that habit, there's countries with national exams, I have heard that free university has a different experience than if it's paid partially in part because of the free nous of it. But also like Ontario is a special jurisdiction like globally because Number one, like 70% of the high school graduates go to university, which is extraordinarily high compared to other jurisdictions. Number two, the government invests for the last 30 years super heavily into the knowledge economy. So super subsidizes like higher education college and university and has like a really high proportion of what are called Knowledge economy positions jobs. So I mean they're not doing it for altruism. They're doing it to like build the economy and create the workforce and we are all part of that. But we also can be aware of it. And we don't have to be like unthinking Cog in the machine. We can do what we want.

SPEAKER 1
Yeah.

SPEAKER 0
Yeah. It's all very interesting. I like the, the interplay between like individual choice and your own personal development versus like state subsidized interventions and like building the workforce and you know, what do you want to do with your life? Do you wanna like, you know, build a career, you want to become like an independent practitioner. A lot of people in the course are looking for a career in the arts which is going to look a lot different than like the code ninja who wants to work in Fang, right? Like the course is a lot of diversity in it. So, but you know, we we can accommodate everyone.

SPEAKER 1
Yeah. Especially after this first introduction meeting, I'm looking, I was already really looking forward to the scores, but now I'm like super looking forward to the scores for sure.

SPEAKER 0
Awesome, awesome. Okay, no problem. I'm going to go so bye to the people are still hanging around who are either interested in this discussion or who have left their computer and are often a different part of their place and there's not even a human on the other side. I don't know. But I think um I'm going to leave money. You can hang around because you're a co horst or we can just end the meeting. What do people want? Can we just end the meeting? I think we should, yeah. Okay. Okay. Yeah. So by everyone. Yeah. Bye. See you on monday. Thank you, professor. No problem at all. By.
