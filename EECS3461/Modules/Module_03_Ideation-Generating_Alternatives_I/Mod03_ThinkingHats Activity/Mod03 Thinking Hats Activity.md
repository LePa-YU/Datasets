==highlighted phrases== indicate places which are links to other documents (links will become active within 24 hours of this document's release)

**Objectives**

- to develop skills in the real-life application of theoretical concepts from ==R-Design-IV-b== (Six Thinking Hats)
- In this activity, we will undertake an "Initial Ideas" activity using the "Six Thinking Hats" approach.  The activity consists of a sequence of four phases, which are scheduled as follows: 

  - Mod03: Blue Hat Round (1 of 2) (Friday-Saturday)
    - To do: learn about the **focus question** of the activity (no submission)
  - Mod03: White Hat Round (Sunday-Monday) (weight: 2%)
    - To do: **contribute 3 entries** in the "White" hat mode of thinking (providing information/posing informational questions); submit via the Mod03: White Hat Round module
  - Mod03: Green Hat Round (Tuesday-Wednesday) (weight: 2%)
    - To do: **contribute 3 entries** in the "Green" hat mode of thinking (lateral thinking; being creative); submit via the Mod03: Green Hat Round module
  - Mod03: Blue Hat Round (2 of 2) (Wednesday onwards, ties into Module 04...)
    - To do: summarize & organize (no submission; we will conduct another round and develop concepts in the next module)

The "Initial Ideas" activity will make use of the Blue, White, and Green thinking styles.  Later, for other activities, we will make use of the Red, Black, and Yellow thinking styles.  

The goal of the "Initial Ideas" activity is to generate a big slate of 



Each phase is described below.

------

#### Mod03: Blue Hat Round (1of 2)

- Friday-Saturday
- The activity starts with all of us assuming the **Blue** hat, to consider how activity will be conducted and to develop our goals and objectives.  
- See ==R-Design-IV-b== for information about the "Blue" hat style of thinking
- In this round, we establish that this activity will have a **focus agenda item** of the activity, and look ahead to understand the success crtieria.

> **Agenda item:** *Both students and instructors find on-line invigilated tests unsatisfactory, but for different reasons.*

------

#### Mod03: White Hat Round

- Sunday-Monday

- In this round, we seek and lay out information.  This will later set the stage for brainstorming.

- See ==R-Design-IV-b== for information about the "White" hat style of thinking.

- Add **3** entries to the activity module Mod03: White Hat Round.  

- Up until the deadline, your entries will be highlighted in red and are pending (not yet added to the database).  You can edit them all the way until the deadline.  Once the deadline passes, the posts will be ingested into the database. You will not be able to edit them after the submission deadline.

- Each entry consists of the following: 

  1. Piece of information: say something that is known about the the agenda item
     - provide a piece of information that is relevant to the focus question
     - two types of information are permitted: "checked" fact, and "personal" fact
       - a checked fact is an assertion or statement for which there is empirical evidence; it is fact or finding; checked facts should be accompanied by the source of evidence
       - a personal fact is something that is true for you, but is not an opinion; it is  a piece of personal knowledge, as in something (such as an fact or finding) that you find to be true for yourself, via your own personal experience; personal facts should be accompanied by a description or a personal anecdote
     - the piece of information should "neutral" in the sense of not being placed within any type of  over-arching argument 
     - be sure to contextualize the piece of information (state it is a checked fact or a personal fact)

  2. Further question(s): given the piece of information, what more/additional would we like to know?
     - Pose a follow-on question, in connection to the piece of information. 
     - the question should probe the checked or personal fact further; the question should be designed to gather further relevant information

Each entry will be rated using the 4-point scale (3 entries x 4 pts each = 12 total points).  

Expectations as follows:

- Meets expectations (3/4): the piece of information is relevant to the probe question; the piece of information is adequately contextualized; the follow-on question is both relevant to the probe question and connected to the piece of information. 
- Exceeds expectations (4/4): highly nuanced piece of information and/or particularly keen and insightful follow-on questions
- Marginally meets expectations (2/4), Below expectations (1/4 or 0/4) as per judgment of grader

------

#### Mod03: Green Hat Round

- Tuesday-Wednesday.  *The round does not open until the White Hat round concludes (midnight on Monday)*
- In this stage, you will digest the informational pieces and the questions from the White Hat round.  You will use this as a starting place for lateral thinking.
- See ==R-Design-IV-b== for information about the "Green" hat style of thinking
- Add **3** entries of **5 ideas each** to the activity module Mod03: Green Hat Round.  
- In each slate, there are 5 entries, each of which an idea (aka a provocation or a "**po**")
  - you can express the idea in a phrase or a sentence (you can use sketches to communicate ideas as well, if you prefer)


Each entry (each set of 5 ideas) will be rated using the 4-point scale (3 batches x 4 pts each = 12 total points).  

Expectations as follows:

- Meets expectations (3/4): the slate of 5 ideas exhibits thinking that moves thinking forward, is an understandable statement that has the potential to lead somewhere, is basically sensible (but not blatantly obvious)
- Exceeds expectations (4/4): the whole slate is "innovative" in the sense of being silly, unusual, wacky, risky (going out on a limb), etc
- Marginally meets expectations (2/4), Below expectations (1/4 or 0/4) as per judgment of grader

### Examples

For this example, I will use **a different agenda item than the one for this exercise**.  You can apply the examples to the activity by analogy.

**an example Agenda item:** *Both Instructors and students find versioned tests/quizzes to be effective, but for different reasons.*

*a "versioned" test refers to a test that comes in different versions, such as the questions in a different order or the questions being slightly different than one another.

#### Example Submission under Mod03: White Hat Round

Note: the first submission is highlighted in red (indicated still in submission; can be edited); the second entry is not highlighted, meaning that it is counted as submitted (can no longer be edited).

These entries would be rated as "Meets Expectations".

### Example Submission under Mod03: Green Hat Round

This slate of 5 ideas would rated as "Meets Expectations".
