### Mod03: Group SCAMPER Activity Specification

**Format**: group based (you will work in randomly divided sub-pods, Module 03 Learning sub-pods) 

**Weight:** 4% 

==highlighted phrases== indicate places which are links to other documents (links will become active within 24 hours of this document's release)

**Objectives**

- to develop skills in the real-life application of theoretical concepts from ==R-Design-III==
- to develop proficiency in shifting between deficit-based and assest-based thinking
- to develop skills in the SCAMPER ideation technique 

#### Instructions

1. read through the exercise description
2. read the deliverable specification (and grading expectations)
3. then (AND ONLY THEN) begin the exercise

#### Exercise Description

First, the members of the sub-pod should introduce themselves to one another, if they haven't already met.  You will be working as team members on this exercise.

The team first needs to choose their probe from the list of ==Mod03 Probes==.

The team then needs to create a shared miro board with the 'SCAMPER' template.  (One team member can create the board and share its URL with full edit access to the other team members)

The team should start by placing the probe in the middle of the SCAMPER board.  

The team should then undertake the SCAMPER technique for their probe.  The team should move through each of the provocations (see ==R-Design-IV==):

- Substitute
- Combine
- Adapt
- Modify
- Put to another use
- Eliminate
- Reverse

Generate at least 7 responses (ideas of "future" or "riffed" situations) for each provocation (7 provocations x 7 ideas for each provocation = 49 ideas) .   See ==R-Design-IV==

#### Deliverable #1: Illustration of SCAMPER Exercise 

- Prepare a visually appealing illustration of the results of the SCAMPER exercise
- It is up to the team to organize the branching and notes
- Ensure the illustration has a title, ensure that all contributors are listed
- Ensure that the smallest font size is 12 pt.
- name the Miro board using the sub-pod's name: i.e.,  `Mod03_Y_SCAMPER_PodZZ`
  - The `Y` in the name will be your pod's section number (either  `A` or  `B` )
  - The `ZZ` in the name will be your sub-pod's identifier (e.g., `A1`, `A2`, `B1`, ...) 

#### Submission and Grading Notes

- the submission will be made on behalf of the **team**
- any member of the team may make the submission (it will be registered under all pod members names)
- the team may submit revised submission up until the submission cut-off date; a new submission will overwrite the prior submission
- the grade will be derived from the application of the grading rubric
- all team members will receive the grade
- any team member who is flagged as a non-contributor through the ==Module03 Team Dynamic Followup== will have their grade removed and replaced with "not submitted" 

##### Exporting the Miro Board

- ==placeholder - instructions for ensuring high resolution for image export==
- before starting, ensure the board is named correctly
- ensure that you have received your educational Miro account (to ensure adequate image resolution when exporting)
- select 'Export this board', and 'Save as image'
- ensure the export region (shown as a white overlay) captures entirety of the illustration (drag the corner handles to reposition the export region)
- select the 'Large' option (the pixel dimensions will vary according to the size of the export region)
- the exported image fill will be downloaded locally (filename will be based on the miro board name)

#### Expectations

The submissions will be assessed using the 4-point scale (Below expectations, Marginally meets expectations, Meets expectations, Exceeds expectations), except where noted otherwise.

To meet expectations:

1. The submission adheres to the specification (e.g., file name and file format are correct, etc) *this is a binary assessment, yes/no*
2. Completeness: all specified elements are present
3. Suitability: *meets expectations* means the responses under each of the 7 questions fit the nature of the question 
4. Innovation: good level of creativity demonstrated for each of the 7 probe questions [weight: 2]
5. Calibre of Presentation: *meets expectations* means that the overall calibre of presentation is good.  This refers to both the elements of graphic design and the elements of written communication (copy is well written, in English without errors of grammar, spelling, text is cohesive, text is coherent, clear and concise).

To achieve 'Exceeds expectations', the submission needs to exceed and go beyond meeting expectations.

#### What to Submit

The submission consists of 2 files.  Ensure they are named correctly.

1. Exported Miro Board: `Mod03_Y_SCAMPER_PodZZ.jpg`
