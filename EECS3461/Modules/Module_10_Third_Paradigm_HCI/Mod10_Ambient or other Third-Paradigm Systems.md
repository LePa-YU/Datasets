==highlighted phrases== indicate places which are links to other documents (links will become active within 24 hours of this document's release)

#### Objectives

- apply and extend knowledge about ambient systems from  ==R-Interaction-V==
- understand and apply design pattern analysis to an established ambient system

#### Description 

This assignment build upon the resource pack ==R-Interaction-V==.  To supplement the material about ambient systems, the following resources are provided:

- Resource Pack: ==3461w21_Resource-Interaction-VI==
- Video: Under ==Module 10 Video Recordings==,  ==3461w21_R-Interaction-VI, Part I==, ==3461w21_R-Interaction-VI, Part II==

You will analyze one ambient system with respect to each of the 4 design dimensions of ambient systems.  You have a choice of 5 papers from which to choose.

#### Task Description 

1. Ensure you understand the 4 design dimensions of ambient systems from R-Interaction-VI
2. Read the paper and generate the content for the assignment template. The report is expected to be 1 page long (or perhaps 2 pages if necessary). Use  narrower margins if possible to fit content to 1 page if necessary. Try not to exceed 1 page unless necessary. DO NOT include a cover page.  Don't use double spacing, or any other choice that creates a large  amount of unnecessary white space. Write concise and clearly, get  directly to the point with a minimum of flowery and verbose language. 
3. Name your file: `Mod10_PaperX_FAMILYNAME.pdf`, where `X` refers to the Paper Number, and `FAMILYNAME` is your own family name.
4. Provide your content in a  properly formatted document, generate and submit the PDF to the  submission module

#### Expectations

- General format: header  section contains the correctly chosen paper, listed as a  correctly-formatted reference, and the required information and sections listed and completed as specified, the format of the submission  adheres to specifications
- section 1: Information  Capacity - at least one system feature or attribute has been clearly  identified and described with respect to this design dimension
- section 2: Notification  Level - at least one system feature or attribute has been clearly  identified and described with respect to this design dimension
- section 3: Representational Fidelity - at least one system feature or attribute has been clearly  identified and described with respect to this design dimension    
- section 4: Aesthetic  Emphasis - at least one system feature or attribute has been clearly  identified and described with respect to this design dimension
