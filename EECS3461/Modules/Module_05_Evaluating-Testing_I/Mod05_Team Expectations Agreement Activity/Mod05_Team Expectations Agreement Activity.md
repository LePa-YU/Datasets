#### Instructions

Setting up effective groups is important both to the students and to the course director. For the students, it is important for many different  reasons (e.g., to accomplishing oneâ€™s goals, to be able to work in a  preferred style, to have an experience    that is as productive and stress-free as possible). For the course  director, it is important for these reasons, and also to ensure a good  learning environment and that principles of equity and justice are  upheld to the greatest extent possible.

#### Expectations

The submissions will be assessed using the 4-point scale (Below expectations, Marginally meets expectations, Meets expectations, Exceeds expectations), except where noted otherwise.

To meet expectations:

1. The submission adheres to the specification. *this is a binary assessment, yes/no*
2. Completeness: all specified elements are present.
3. Calibre of Presentation: *meets expectations* means that the overall calibre of presentation is good (the formatting is intact).    This also refers to the elements of written communication (copy is well written, in English without errors of grammar, spelling, text is cohesive, text is coherent, clear and concise).

To achieve 'Exceeds expectations', the submission needs to exceed and go beyond meeting expectations.  The criterion for which this can happen is 'Completeness' (e.g., extra care and thoroughness in the )
