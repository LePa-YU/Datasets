### EECS3461 Fall 2021

### TEMPLATE : Team Expectations Agreement 

All sections of the format "==<list here>==" must be completed 

#### Team Composition

Team Name: ==<list it here>==

Team Members: 

==<list them here one per line>==

#### Team Expectations

The members of the team listed above hereby agree to the following expectations.  The roles are described in the appendix. 

##### 1. Use of Roles

For this team, the following roles will be performed as follows:

**Task Completer(s):** ==<list the team member or member>==

**Coordinator:**==<list the team member>==

**Recorder:** ==<list the team member>==

**Checker/Submitter:** ==<list the team member>==

It is the team’s collective responsibility to ensure that each team member understands their role(s). 

##### 2. Clarity about Communications

The team agrees to use the following platform(s) to communicate: ==<list here>==

The team members agree to respond within the following time window: ==<list here>==

##### 3. Clarity about Responsibilities

A team member, upon agreeing to undertake a segment of work, agrees to be responsible for the completion of the work segment.

If there is a lack of clarity about the responsibility of a particular work segment, it is the responsibility of the ==<list here>== (name role here, e.g., coordinator, recorder, monitor, checker) to flag this lack of clarity. It is the responsibility of the ==<list here>== (name the role, the team member, or the entire Team) to rectify the lack of clarity.

##### 4. Decision Making

In the case that a contentious decision must be made, the Team agrees to employ the following method: 

==<use sentences to describe approach, possibilities include: by majority vote, by decision made by a particular role, discussion until convergence is reached>==  

The team agrees to abide by this decision making approach.

##### 5. Division of Work and Goal Setting

For any particular phase or deliverable of the course project, the team agrees to collectively discuss and determine the shared goal in terms of aspects such as desired grade outcome, allocation of team member time (when and how much)

The division of work will be accomplished by consensus and with clarity among all team members. 

The work will be divided using the following approach(es): 
==<use sentences to describe approach, possibilities include: *by volunteer basis,* *by consensus, by the coordinator, etc* >== 

##### 6. Conflict Resolution

Despite the team members’ best efforts, conflicts may yet arise. It is human nature.  

In cases of a disagreement or conflict, the process our Team will employ to resolve the conflict will be: 

==<use sentences to describe approach, possibilities include:  to use a mediator bring the two parties together to talk it through (if so, then who would be the mediator?), to have a good-faith commitment to come to a resolution; to hold a Team meeting to discuss the problem and to resolve by majority vote; to use a particular framework (e.g., several are published on-line and can be found via a search “approaches to conflict resolution on Teams”)==

##### 7. Team-Based Handling of Teamwork Issues

If a problem arises, then the Team should make a good-faith effort to resolve the problem. Consult with the course director for feedback and guidance.

##### 8. Firing and Quitting: Problems with a Team Member

If there are any problems with a team member, the team will first use the clause "Team-Based Handling of Teamwork Issues" above. 

As a drastic step, a Team may fire a Team member and a Team member may quit their Team. 

**Flagging the problem:** If the Team feels that one Team member is not cooperating and/or not completing agreed-upon work, then this should be flagged as a problem. The Team should discuss this. If needed, consult with the course director for feedback and guidance.

**Escalation:** If the problem persists, the cooperating Team members may notify the uncooperative member in writing that he/she is in danger of being fired, sending a copy of the communication to the course director. The memo should specifically describe what is being asked of the uncooperative Team member, in terms of desired improvements and the timeline. The course director will monitor the content of the memo to ensure that the requests are reasonable.

If there is no subsequent improvement within the timeline, the Team members may decide, by consensus, to ‘fire’ the non-cooperative Team member. In this case, the Team should notify the individual in writing (copy to the course director) that he/she is no longer with the Team (aka ‘fired’).  The team members will indicate this in the Activity Follow-up Modules.

Students who get fired must: (1) find another team willing to add them as a member; (2) complete the deliverables working alone; or (3) get grades of zero for the team activity deliverables. 

##### 9. Leaving the Team: Problems with a Non-Cooperative Team

If a single team member is consistently doing all the work for their team, they should consult with the course director for feedback and guidance. If the situation cannot be rectified using usual means, then the team member may choose to issue a warning communication that they will quit unless they start getting cooperation within a reasonable amount of time (which must be specified). They may issue a second communication  quitting the team if the cooperation is not forthcoming.  The course instructor will work with the team member to rectify the grading issue and to assist with finding a new team. It is likely that a new team can be found, but not 100% guaranteed. 

##### 10. Other Clauses (optional)

==<add any other clauses here (e.g., expectation about attending meetings, not being late, how the Team will communicate, how responsive Team members should be to one another, etc)>==

#### Signed and dated by:

This document will be deemed signed and dated by virtue of a team member confirming their submission to the eClass module.



### Appendix

Project work can be complex and multi-faceted. Your team will have a number of responsibilities as it completes the project phases and each member will need to contribute. To help structure this work, the team agrees to make use of roles. Every team member will act as ‘Task Completer’ and additional roles must also be filled. Suggested roles are provided below. Your team may elect to use other roles, provided they are clearly defined. 

For each deliverable, the team will designate members for each of these roles**.** It is suggested to rotate these roles for every phase. The role responsibilities and serving team member will be recorded for each submission.

It is the team’s collective responsibility to ensure that each team member understands their role(s).

#### Task Completer

- Completes tasks associated with the deliverables, as determined by the team’s strategy

#### Coordinator:

- checks with other team members before all team meetings (if any), to remind them of when and where they will meet and what they are supposed to do.
- during meetings, keeps everyone on task and makes sure everyone is involved
- takes notes and records action items, communicates action items to entire team

#### Recorder: 

- responsible for coordinating the preparation of deliverables to be submitted (not necessarily the sole author, but rather co-ordinates components as prepared by team members) 

#### Monitor:

- ensures that action items are completed; follows up if not
- reflects upon the team’s deliverable and the team’s strategy used to get it
- checks to makes sure everyone understands the team’s solution and the strategy used to get it, ensures understanding is shared among all team members

#### Checker/Submitter: 

- learns and understands the criteria for phase, shares with other team members
- double-checks the deliverables against criteria before submission and leads process to revise (if desired by team)
- has responsibility to submit deliverables before submission deadline
