### Mod05: Heuristic Evaluation Activity Specification

**Format**: group based (see ==Mod05: Finalized Groups==)

**Weight:** 7% 

==highlighted phrases== indicate places which are links to other documents (links will become active within 24 hours of this document's release)

**Objectives**

- to develop skills in the real-life application of heuristic evaluation criteria, to apply concepts from ==R-Interaction-II==, ==R-Interaction-III==

#### Activity Description

Your project team will complete a design critique of a prototype Venn diagram tool using heuristic evaluation criteria for the critique framework.

1. Your project team will choose either Shneiderman’s  'eight golden rules’ or Nielsen and Molich’s 10 User Interface design guidelines.  
2. For the critique, your group will generate one or more observations with respect to each of the criteria as per your choice above.  The observation can be an adherence to or a violation of the criteria.
3. To illustrate the observation, you should generate a short video 'walkthrough' that demonstrates the observation.  This should be a short video clip (such as 10-30 seconds, although longer or shorter is fine if it gets the point across)
4. Capture a video recording of the demonstration of the observation. You can use a voice over or overlay text in post production for the observation.   QuickTime has a very easy-to-use screen recording feature. For video capture and other aspects of video production, you can also consult: http://smart-toolbox.eecs.yorku.ca/

Name each video clip in a way that corresponds to the criteria, as specified below.  The extension will depend on the video file format  (e.g., .mp4)

- Nielsen and Molich
  - `01_visibility`
  - `02_system_realworld_match`
  - `03_user_control`
  - `04_consistency_standards`
  - `05_error_prevention`
  - `06_recognition_recall`
  - `07_flexibility_and_efficiency`
  - `08_aesthetic`
  - `09_errors`
  - `10_help`
-   Shneiderman
  - `01_consistency`
  - `02_universal_usability`
  - `03_informative_feedback`
  - `04_dialogs`
  - `05_prevent_errors`
  - `06_reversal`
  - `07_users_in_control`
  - `08_memory_load`

#### The Venn Diagram App

There are 5 different prototype apps.  Your project team has been randomly assigned one of the 5 variants.  The mappings are provided in the appendix below.

The assignments can be found under ==Mod05: Venn Diagram App Assignments==.



#### Deliverable #1: The Media Gallery

- Submit each video clip to the media gallery under ==Mod05: Heuristic Evaluation Activity==. 

- There should be 8 or 10 video clip items uploaded to your team's gallery (the number  depending on your choice of guidelines, as listed above)
- There should be a effective gallery thumbnail.  Your team should develop an image and upload it to the gallery.  Select 'Yes' for "Use as thumbnail" (deselect for the video clips)
- Add each clip as an item to the gallery
  - under Caption, provide the name of the file (adhere to the naming specification above)
  - provide an illustrative thumbnail for the video clip
  - complete the remaining fields

#### Submission and Grading Notes

- the submission will be made on behalf of the **team**
- any member of the team may make the submission (it will be registered under all pod members names)
- the team may submit revised submission up until the submission cut-off date; a new submission will overwrite the prior submission
- the grade will be derived from the application of the grading rubric
- all team members will receive the grade
- any team member who is flagged as a non-contributor through the ==Module05 Team Dynamic Followup== will have their grade removed and replaced with "not submitted" 



#### Expectations

The submissions will be assessed using the 4-point scale (Below expectations, Marginally meets expectations, Meets expectations, Exceeds expectations), except where noted otherwise.

To meet expectations:

1. The submission adheres to the specifications: the uploaded video clips are named as specified, the file formats are correct, the gallery is composed as video clips, the gallery has an illustrative thumbnail. etc *this is a binary assessment, yes/no*
2. For each criterion:
   1. Completeness: the observation is made, as per specification above
   2. Innovation/Calibre: good level of insight and analysis demonstrated for the criterion
   3. Calibre of Presentation: *meets expectations* means that the overall calibre of presentation is good.  The video clip is clear, concise, intelligible, has reasonable production quality.

To achieve 'Exceeds expectations', the submission needs to exceed and go beyond meeting expectations.

###  JAR FILES

The prototypes can be found in the directories below. Each one as a jar file. 

Typically, to run a jar file, you can invoke the command `java -jar <name of jarfile>.jar`

Please note that many of these jar files make use of Java FX.  Unfortunately, Java FX is no longer packaged with the Java runtime. If  your assigned jar file uses JavaFX, depending on your setup, you may  need to do some configuration. Here is the documentation that you will need to use: https://openjfx.io/openjfx-docs/

You may need to manually configure the PATH_TO_FX environment variable.

Once you complete the configuration, the command is: 

`java --module-path $PATH_TO_FX --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml -jar *jar`
