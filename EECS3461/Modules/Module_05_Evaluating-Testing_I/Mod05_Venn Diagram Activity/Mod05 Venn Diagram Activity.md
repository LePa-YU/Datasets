#### Activity Description

The Venn Diagram Activity is activity typically assigned by a course instructor to a group of learners.  It intended to provide learners with a way to reflect on and to analyse course materials.  For the ==Mod05: Heuristic Evaluation Activity==, you will evaluate some a prototype software application that was designed by a student team to support the Venn Diagram Activity.  Before doing this, you need to become more familiar with the Venn Diagram activity and see how the activity needs to work.  Previously, this would be a pen-and-paper exercise, but nowadays, instructors want to have the students do the activity as an online class activity.

In the activity, the group members construct a Venn Diagram to illustrate the connection between two pieces of materials (e.g., videos, readings, images, etc).  One circle represents each of the two pieces of material, and the intersection of the two circles is used to represents points that are common to both pieces of material.

For this activity, you will analyse these two videos:

- video 1: Secrets Of Successful Teamwork: Insights From Google
   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHIikHJV9fI&feature=youtu.be

-  video 2: The Cart - Performia https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQC5jnj68ko

The Venn diagram has four regions: 

- the part of circle 1 representing video 1 only, 
- the part of circle 2 representing  video 2 only, 
- the intersection of circle 1 and circle 2, representing both video 1 and  video 2
- the region outside of both circles, representing points that apply to neither video 1 nor  video 2

Identify at least 3 bullet points for each of the 4 regions.  Each bullet point needs to refer to an issue raised, a piece of advice, an observation, or any other piece of content derived from or connected to the video. 

#### Deliverable #1: Miro Board with Venn Diagram Illustration 

- Prepare a visually appealing Venn Diagram illustration using Miro
- It is up to the team to decide how organize the circles and the text points
- Ensure the illustration has a title, ensure that all contributors are listed
- Ensure that the smallest font size is no smaller than 12 pt.
- Name the Miro board using the group name: i.e.,  `Mod05_SecY_GroupZZ`  (however it is listed in ==Mod05: Finalized Groups==) 
  - The `Y` in the name will be your pod's section number (either  `A` or  `B` )
  - The `ZZ` in the name will be your group's identifier (e.g., `01`, `02`, `03`, ...) 

#### Submission and Grading Notes

- the submission will be made on behalf of the **team**
- any member of the team may make the submission (it will be registered under all pod members names)
- the team may submit revised submission up until the submission cut-off date; a new submission will overwrite the prior submission
- the grade will be derived from the application of the grading rubric
- all team members will receive the grade
- any team member who is flagged as a non-contributor through the ==Module05 Team Dynamic Followup== will have their grade removed and replaced with "not submitted" 

##### Exporting the Miro Board

- Before starting, ensure that all team members have the educational plan activated in Miro
  - Check under your settings, and under 'Team profile', the type of plan will be listed under 'Your plan details'.  The plan type should be 'Educational'
  - If you haven't already, upgrade the plan to received your free educational Miro account, to ensure adequate image resolution when exporting)
- Before starting, ensure the board is named correctly
- select 'Export this board', and 'Save as image'
- ensure the export region (shown as a white overlay) captures entirety of the illustration (drag the corner handles to reposition the export region)
- select the 'Large' option (the pixel dimensions will vary according to the size of the export region)
- the exported image will be downloaded locally (filename will be based on the miro board name)

#### Expectations

The submissions will be assessed using the 4-point scale (Below expectations, Marginally meets expectations, Meets expectations, Exceeds expectations), except where noted otherwise.

To meet expectations:

1. The submission adheres to the specification (e.g., file name and file format are correct, etc) *this is a binary assessment, yes/no*
2. Completeness: all specified elements are present, at least 3 bullet points for each of the four regions in the Venn diagram
3. Innovation/Calibre: good level of insight and analysis demonstrated for each of the bullet points
4. Calibre of Presentation: *meets expectations* means that the overall calibre of presentation is good.  This refers to both the elements of graphic design and the elements of written communication (copy is well written, in English without errors of grammar, spelling, text is cohesive, text is coherent, clear and concise).

To achieve 'Exceeds expectations', the submission needs to exceed and go beyond meeting expectations.
