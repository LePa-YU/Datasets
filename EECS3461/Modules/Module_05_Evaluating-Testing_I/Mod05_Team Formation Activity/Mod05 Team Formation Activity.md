**Format**: within Learning Pods

**Weight:**  no weight for this activity, however, other components depend on the successful completion of this activity.

==highlighted phrases== indicate places which are links to other documents (links will become active within 24 hours of this document's release)

**Objectives**

- for students to be formed into groups of size 3, using a process that is as fair as possible
- these groups (will be called Mod05_SecX_TeamYY), will then work to complete Mod05: Venn Diagram Activity and Mod05: Heuristic Evaluation Activity

#### Instructions

**Step1:** We will move into our learning pods in breakout rooms

**Step 2:** Discuss among the pod members how you might like to self-divide into groups of size 3

Ideally, you will choose your group members from among your pod mates (after all, we spent all this time to get to know one another).  But this will not be enforced.  You can choose your group members from other pods if you like.

Groups must be formed within each Section.  (All members must be from the same section).

**Step 3:** Each person chooses: 

1. to be placed in random group (See below for further information)
2. to form a group among willing members (See below for further information)

Indicate your choice via:

- ==Mod05, Sec A: Indicate group preference== deadline Wed Oct 27 midnight
- ==Mod05, Sec B: Indicate group preference== deadline Fri Oct 29 midnight

**Once the deadline passes, you will be placed in a group.** See: ==Mod05: Finalized Groups==

**Step 4:** The next day after your section deadline has passed, your group choice will be finalized and published



#### NOTES:

If you want to be randomly placed in a group, select "Mod05_Sec{A|B}_DesireRandomAllocation".  You can change your mind at any point.

If you want to choose to be in a specific group, you can do so. Since the group choice activity can be completed by any student, and since anyone may modify their choice all the way up to the end of the response period, this means that there is some degree of coordination required among group members.

There are different scenarios:

- A student can just sign up for an empty slot and wait to see if two other students join in the other empty slots.  If one or two slots remain empty by the end of the response period, a student will be added randomly.  But this is the same as signing up to be placed in a group randomly.  So just do that.
- A pair of students can sign up for the same group and wait to see if a third students joins.  If the slot remains empty by the end of the response period, a student will be added randomly. 
- Three students can sign up for the same group in a coordinated fashion.
  - Example of Coordination: Students A, B, and C want to form a group.  Students A and B sign up for a group choice, taking 2 of the three empty slots.  Student D signs up for the third slot.  The group can remain A, B, and D.  Or as an alternative, students A and B can remove themselves and choose instead another group, coordinating with Student C so that they sign up and fill the third slot. 

If a student fails to complete the activity, it will be assumed that they choose to be randomly placed in a group. Non-answering students will be grouped with one another.

It is not an option to choose to work in groups of 1 or 2.  The number of students in each section is not a multiple of 3 and so one or two groups may be short a member.  No group of only 1 student will be formed.



#### Deliverable #1: Team Agreement

- This activity does not have a deliverable.  However, you will need to be in a finalized group in order to complete the rest of the activities in Module 05.


#### Expectations

It is expected that each student reads and understands the process for team formation.  Ignorance of the process will not be acceptable as grounds for exceptions later on.

#### What to Submit

There is nothing to submit for this activity.  See Mod05: Team Agreement Activity for information about the deliverable (weight: 1%)
