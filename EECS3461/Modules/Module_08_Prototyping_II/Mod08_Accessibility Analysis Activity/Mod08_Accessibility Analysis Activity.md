### Mod08: Accessibility Analysis Activity Specification

**Format**: individual

**Weight:** 4% 

==highlighted phrases== indicate places which are links to other documents (links will become active within 24 hours of this document's release)

#### Objectives

- consider and apply the 7 principles of Universal Design to a real-life example (see ==R-Interaction-IV== (Accessibility))
- learn background knowledge so as to be able to relate  accessibility in the built-environment to IT accessibility in subsequent activities

#### Background: Real Life Examples

##### Example 1: Robson square

Robson square is a complex located in Vancouver, BC that integrates together several elements: a public space, plazas, and a set of  surrounding buildings (including an art gallery and law courts). The  complex includes many elements, including landscaping  and a roof garden. One of the most notable elements is a set of  stairs with ramps integrated within. Simon Scott, the director of Erickson's Foundation, said of the late  architect: "He wanted to make public spaces accessible and enjoyable,"

 Stairs with integrated ramps are  often referred to using the portmanteau word "stramps".

##### Example 2: Interactive System

There are many interactive systems (commercial and/or open source) that are meant for 'general use'.  You can choose any type of digital interactive system on any digital platform as your example, provided that it can be cited and that you actually have access to it.

#### What to Do

You will first choose either Example 1 (the Robson Square Stramp) or Example 2 (a digital interactive system of your choice) for this activity.  

In the template below, you must state the example chosen.  You can simply state 'Robson Square Stramp' if that is your choice.  If you are choosing an example under category Example 2, you must clearly describe the system being analyzed (provide a link/cite so that the grader can locate the system).

You will then analyze your example with respect to each of  the UD principles. 

For each principle, provide a rationale as to the  why the example either demonstrates or violates it. 

To meet  expectations, each rationale should be based on at least one point that is germane to the UD principle.  You may elect to go above and beyond, if desired.

##### Submission Format

Copy the answer template provided below into the on-line submission text box. 

The template headers are formatted using 'Heading (medium)' or  <h4>. Please maintain the header formatting. Do not use any heading format 'Heading (large)' (level <h3> or higher).  Under each template section, provide your content. Do not add any links to your content.  Images are allowed if desired. 

Do not use any formatting so that the template headers lose their prominence.  

This format must be followed in order to streamline the grading workflow.
