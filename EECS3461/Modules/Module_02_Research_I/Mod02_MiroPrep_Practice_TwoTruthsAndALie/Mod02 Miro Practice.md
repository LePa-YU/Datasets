### PRACTICE, Mod02: Miro Practice, Two Truths and a Lie

**Format**: pod-based 

**Weight:** none, this is a practice activity

#### Objectives

- become familiar with Miro's functionality
- get to know your podmates a bit better

#### What to Do

##### Step 1

- get signed into Miro
- If you don't already have an account, you are eligible to receive a no-cost educational account
- Follow the instructions here: https://miro.com/signup/     
  - **use your Passport York email during sign-up** (this is important later in order to receive the educational account)
  - the basic account gives you 3 editable boards
  - You can also receive an educational account, for additional functionality, such as unlimited editable boards, password protection, team voting, etc (see https://help.miro.com/hc/en-us/articles/360017730233 for plan comparison)
  - to obtain the account, follow the instructions here: https://help.miro.com/hc/en-us/articles/360017730473-Education-Plan (use a screen shot of York's home webpage and a photo of your student id)

##### Step 2

- establish a new board for the pod, give the board the same name as the pod  
  - one person will need to be the owner and will share it with the pod mates via invite link
  - more advanced: set up a team and invite all team members
- you don't need to use a template (just dismiss the template dialogue box)
- each person creates a personalized element (see below)
- the board is done when each pod member has completed their personalized element

##### Step 3

- the board owner ensures reactions are enabled for all (turned on by default)
- each person takes a turn, says their name and says each of the three items from their "two truths and a lie"
- team mates use reactions to flag which of the three items they think is the lie
- at the end, the person says which of the three items was the lie

#### Personal Element

- your personal element needs  to include your name
- your personal element needs to include three items: two truths and one lie
