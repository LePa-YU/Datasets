See "Forum Posting Guidelines" below

### Deliverable #1: Knowledge Claim based on Quantitative Data 

worth: 2%

Present one example of a *knowledge claim* in the form of a posting to Mod02 Forum Submission: Quantitative Data

1. Provide a brief statement of the knowledge claim that is being made in a research article on the basis of quantitative data (either entirely or in-part). You don't need to be super extensive, just convey the gist of what is being said.
   - the article should be chosen from one of the following Proceedings (any year):
     - CHI EA: Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems-Extended Abstracts
     - CHI PLAY: Computer-Human Interaction in Play
     - CHI: Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems
     - see the resource =="Accessing the ACM Digital Library"== for information
   - try to choose an article in an area that is of interest to you
2. the article should describe research that makes use of **quantitative** data (it doesn't need to be based exclusively on quantitative data)
3. Identify whether you feel that it is *knowledge-that* or *knowledge-how*
4. Provide a brief statement of the data upon which the knowledge claim rests
5. provide a full reference (in ACM Ref format)

Add a graphical element at the bottom to help illustrate the point!

*examples are provided below*

### Deliverable #2: Knowledge Claim based on Qualitative Data 

worth: 2%

Present one example of a *knowledge claim* in the form of a posting to Mod02 Forum Submission: Qualitative Data

1. Provide a brief statement of the knowledge claim that is being made in a research article on the basis of qualitative data (either entirely or in-part). You don't need to be super extensive, just convey the gist of what is being said.

### Forum Posting Guidelines

- Use the editor to prepare your posting

  - eClass offers the Atto editor https://docs.moodle.org/311/en/Atto_editor 
  - feel free to use all of the functionality (e.g., images and formatting, but DO NOT embed files)
  - attachments have been turned off

- Once you submit your posting, it stays in draft form for 15 minutes. You have 15 minutes to edit your draft.  

- Once 15 minutes elapses, your draft gets posted.  Once it is posted, you may not go back and edit it.

- The forum is set up so that you will be able to see the posting of others only once your own posting appears.

  

### Expectations

Each posting will be assessed using the 4-point scale (Below expectations, Marginally meets expectations, Meets expectations, Exceeds expectations), except where noted otherwise.

To meet expectations, the posting must demonstrate:

1. Completeness/Correctness: all specified elements are present and are free of blatant error
2. Clarity: each of the specified elements are clearly depicted 
3. Good Calibre of Presentation: *meets expectations* means that the overall calibre of presentation is good.  This refers to both the elements of graphic design and the elements of written communication (copy is well written, in English without errors of grammar, spelling, text is cohesive, text is coherent, clear and concise).

To achieve 'Exceeds expectations', the submission needs to exceed and go beyond meeting expectations. 

### Examples

------

#### Example #1A,  a Posting that could be made to Mod02 Forum Submission: Quantitative Data

*this posting would receive 'Meets Expectations'*

#1 and #2: wearable devices should make notifications to be based on sound, this is an example of knowledge-that

#3: the researchers studied response time

#### Example #1B, a Posting that could be made to Mod02 Forum Submission: Quantitative Data

*this posting would receive 'Exceeds Expectations'*

1. **Knowledge Claim:** If rock climbers are going to use a wearable device that has notifications, then they will prefer these notifications to be based on sound (as opposed to a notification based on vibration or light), at least based on the sample that was studied

2. **An example of:** *knowledge-that*
3. **Data used in the knowledge claim:** response time (msec) for different conditions (including vibration, sound, light)

#### Example #2A, a Posting that could be made to Mod02 Forum Submission: Qualitative Data

*this posting would receive 'Meets Expectations'*

#1: players of digital games cheat and "They do so to facilitate mood repair, stress relief, and flow, and to exercise agency over satisfying their psychological needs during gameplay."

#2 this is an example of knowledge-that

#3: the researchers studied questionnaire data

#### Example #2B, a Posting that could be made to Mod02 Forum Submission: Quantitative Data

*this posting would receive 'Exceeds Expectations'*

1. **Knowledge Claim:** Players of digital games often cheat (also called Extraneous Game Advantage or EGA), and they do so to facilitate mood repair and flow, to get stress  relief,  and  to  exercise  agency  over satisfying their psychological needs during gameplay.

2. **An example of:** *knowledge-that*
3. **Data used in the knowledge claim:** written answers provided by players in response to questions about their prior experiences and their feelings and emotions
