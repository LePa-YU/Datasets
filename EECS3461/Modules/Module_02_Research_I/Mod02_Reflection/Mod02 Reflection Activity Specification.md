### Mod02: Reflection Specification

**Format**: individual 

**Weight:** 1% 

#### Objectives

- for you to build reflective habits and a reflective mindset: develop an ability and willingness to reflect on your own experiences to gain more learning from them; to develop insights on your own learning style and processes

#### What to Do

This is a reflection activity, part of Module 02: Research I

The reflection activity for module 02 will be completed via questions posed in the "quiz" format.
Because the Mod02: Sources of Knowledge Activity* was extended to 11:59pm Wednesday, this reflection activity is also extended. 
*(see Mod02: Sources of Knowledge Activity Specification)

There is no timelimit, you can revise your entries as many times as you like, up until the closing time.

Take about 5-10 minutes to respond, via Mod02: Reflection, to the questions below :

##### Question 1: 

In the Mod02: Sources of Knowledge Activity Specification, you were asked to identify one knowledge claim that was based on  quantitative data, and one knowledge claim that was based on qualitative data. 
Do you think one type of data is superior to the other  (e.g., quantitative or qualitative) for practitioners working in  interaction design? Why or why not? Explain in one or two sentences

##### Question 2:

In the Mod02: Systems in the Wild Activity, you were tasked with findings lots of examples of interactive systems 'from the wild'. What was an  example that was  identified within your pod that surprised you and why?  ('surprised' in the sense of not fitting with your initial assumptions about what counts as an interactive system).  If there was no such example, what would be a surprising example and why?
(provide 1-2 sentences)

#### Assessment

- Your journal entry will be assessed using the 4-point scale: Below expectations, Marginally meets expectations, Meets expectations, Exceeds expectations.
- 'Meets expectations' is calibrated to a grade of B/B+.
- To meet expectations, students are expected to provided at least 1 substantive sentence for each question. 
- Substantive means 'having substance', as in being based in one's own personal experience and being connected to the substance of the question. 
- Generic and vague statements will not meet expectations.
- Exceeding expectations means going above and beyond the bar of meeting expectations.
