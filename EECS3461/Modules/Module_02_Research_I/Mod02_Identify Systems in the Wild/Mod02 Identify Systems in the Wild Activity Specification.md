### Mod02: Systems in the Wild Activity Specification

**Format**: group based (Module 02 Learning Pods) ***NOTE: the pods have been slightly reformed for Module 02***

**Weight:** 4% 

==highlighted phrases== indicate places which are links to other documents (links will become active within 24 hours of this document's release)

**Objectives**

- to develop skills in the real-life application of theoretical concepts from R-Interaction-I
- to further develop skills in project management and teamwork

#### Deliverable #1 Specification: Miro Poster

- the pod will prepare a visually appealing poster that illustrates the wide breadth of different interactive systems 
- the poster should follow a Mind Map format (see below), the central concept is "Diversity of Interactive Systems"
- it is up to the team to organize the branching, but the following should be effectively conveyed:

  - that there is a diversity of the different platforms (think in terms of digital platforms, but if you want to delve into non-digital interactive "platforms" that is not excluded)
  - that there is diversity in terms of  **attention**  (the degree to which the user's attention is demanded) and **user physicality** (the degree to which the user is 'captively' positioned with the system or 'in motion'): both of these connect to posture
  - platform, posture, user attention, user physicality: these concepts relate directly to ==R-Interaction-I==
  - the 'leaves' of the tree should be illustrations of actual examples of interactive systems (use an illustrative image)
  - to meet expectations, the poster should contain at least 15 actual examples; it is up to the team whether to represent 15 different platforms and one posture per platform or a smaller number of different platforms and more than one postures for some platforms  
- the poster should demonstrate good use of the principles of graphic design (i.e., balance, alignment, hierarchy, contrast, rhythm, proximity, colour and space)
- name the Miro board using the pod's name: i.e.,  `Mod02_PodY-Z`
  - The `Y` in the name will be your pod's section number (either  `A` or  `B` )
  - The `Z` in the name will be your pod's identifier (e.g., `A`, `B`, `C`, ...) 

##### Concept Mapping

- A concept map is a means to organize information in a non-linear and graphical format
- The concept map diagram format represents things (e.g., tasks, words, concepts, or items) linked to and arranged around a central concept or subject, with additional levels radiating out of the central concept
- The concept map format allows for the building of an intuitive framework around a central concept
- see https://www.mindmapping.com/mind-map (this example is for mind map, but is basically compatible for concept maps)



#### Deliverable #2 Specification: Teamwork Notes

- prepare a short document that describes how the project management work undertaken
- the format of the document is up to the team
- Be sure to include:
  - how did the group identify the work to be done?
  - how did the group divide up the work?
  - how did the group check the work?
  - how did the group get the files correctly prepared and submitted on time?

##### File Format and File Naming

- the format for the file should be one of: word doc (`.docx`), rich text file (`.rtf`) or markdown (`.md`) 
- Name the file:  `Mod02_PodY-Z_TeamworkNotes.docx` (other variants permitted: `Mod02_PodY-Z_TeamworkNotes.md`, `Mod02_PodY-Z_TeamworkNotes.rtf`)
  - Replace the `X` in the filename with your pod's section number (either  `A` or  `B` )
  - Replace the `Y` with your pods identifier (e.g., `A`, `B`, `C`, ...) 

##### 

#### What to Do

##### Phase 1: Project Planning

- After reading the specifications for the deliverables, the pod should engage in a planning phase
- Read the documents ==Project Management in EECS3461: Pod Activities== and ==Project Management Guidance for Mod02: Identify Systems in the Wild Activity==
- Wrap up this phase once the project management planning is established

##### Phase 2: Doing the Work

- proceed with the work, each pod member doing their part, as per the strategy developed in the planning phase
- be sure to include a checking and feedback sub-phase

##### Phase 3: Preparing and Submitting the Poster 

- once the two deliverables are checked, submit them as per the instructions below

#### Submission and Grading Notes

- the submission will be made on behalf of the **entire learning pod**
- any member of the pod may make the submission (it will be registered under all pod members names)
- the pod may submit revised submission up until the submission cut-off date; a new submission will overwrite the prior submission
- the grade will be derived from the application of the grading rubric
- all pod members will receive the grade
- any pod member who is flagged as a non-contributor through the ==Module02 Team Dynamic Followup== will have their grade removed and replaced with "not submitted" 

##### Exporting the Miro Board

- before starting, ensure the board is named correctly
- select 'Export this board', and 'Save as image'
- ensure the export region (shown as a white overlay) captures entirety of the poster (drag the corner handles to reposition the export region)
- select the 'Large' option (the pixel dimensions will vary according to the size of the export region)
- the exported image fill will be downloaded locally (filename will be based on the miro board name)

#### Expectations

The submissions will be assessed using the 4-point scale (Below expectations, Marginally meets expectations, Meets expectations, Exceeds expectations), except where noted otherwise.

To meet expectations:

1. The submission adheres to the specification (e.g., file name and file format are correct, etc) *this is a binary assessment, yes/no*
2. Completeness: all specified elements are present
3. Clarity: *meets expectations* means each of the specified elements are clearly depicted 
4. Creativity (for Deliverable #1): good level of creativity demonstrated
5. Calibre of Presentation: *meets expectations* means that the overall calibre of presentation is good.  This refers to both the elements of graphic design and the elements of written communication (copy is well written, in English without errors of grammar, spelling, text is cohesive, text is coherent, clear and concise).

To achieve 'Exceeds expectations', the submission needs to exceed and go beyond meeting expectations.

#### What to Submit

The submission consists of 2 files.  Ensure they are named correctly.

1. Exported Miro Board: `Mod02_PodY-Z.jpg`

2. The Team Notes: one of  `Mod02_PodY-Z_TeamworkNotes.docx` (or `Mod02_PodY-Z_TeamworkNotes.md` or  `Mod02_PodY-Z_TeamworkNotes.rtf`)
