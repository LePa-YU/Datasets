Why is it challenging to define what is meant by a 'user interface'?  (Choose the answer that best reflects the resource pack materials)
A) because characterizing 'user interface' boils down to characterizing interaction and technology, both of which are nuanced 
B) because there are so many different types, it is difficult to list them all
C) because UX designers and Computer Scientists use different meanings for this term
D) because computing technology has advanced so far, creating fuzzy boundaries and cyborgs
ANSWER: A
What is the definition of an interface from the computing domain?
A) an interface is a shared boundary across which two or more separate components exchange information
B) an interface is a shared boundary across which a human and a digital component exchange information
C) an interface is a shared boundary between a client and server, the API
D) an interface is a shared boundary between sensors and articulators
ANSWER: A
What is the main idea of co-evolution? (Choose the answer that best reflects the resource pack materials)
A) The digital artefacts that are designed shape us humans, and we humans shape the digital artefacts are are designed
B) faster mouse, faster mousetrap: there is an arms race between designers and humans 
C) appropriation is stronger that adoption
D) dominant interests get reflected in technological artefacts
ANSWER: A
What is the main idea of inscription? (Choose the answer that best reflects the resource pack materials)
A) social actors --- with presumed aspirations, motives and other attributed --- arise in the predictive vision of designers, and then designers inscribe the vision of these presumed social actors into the artefacts that they create
B) technology is mostly created by the most powerful societal forces
C) technology is mostly created by the dominant societal forces
D) social actors influence designers via dominant market research, and then designers inscribe this empirical data into the artefacts that they create
ANSWER: A
What is meant by soft technology? (Choose the answer that best reflects the resource pack materials)
A) an assembly that orchestrates phenomena to some purpose using concepts, such as categorization schemes
B) an assembly that orchestrates non-technical phenomena to some purpose
C) an assembly that orchestrates phenomena to some purpose using concepts, such as single board computers like Raspberry Pi
D) an assembly that orchestrates social phenomena to some purpose
ANSWER: A
What are the essential components of a digital platform? (Choose the answer that best reflects the resource pack materials)
A) the ability to perform digital computation, plus the capability to detect input actions from the user and to articulate output actions that can be perceived by the user
B) the capability to detect input actions from the user and to articulate output actions that can be perceived by the user
C) the capability to have physical form
D) the capability to have an operating system and network connectivity
ANSWER: A

C) augmented reality heads-up displays 
D) shape-memory alloys 
ANSWER: D
What is meant by digital artefact 'posture'? (Choose the best answer)
A) the predominant manner in which the digital artefact asks and requires things of the user (such as attention and body position)
B) the predominant manner in which the digital artefact “presents itself” to users
C) the predominant manner in which the digital artefact is aligned with the body posture of the user
D) the predominant manner in which the digital artefact is aligned with its underlying digital platform
ANSWER: A
