### Mod04: Group Figma Activity Specification

**Format**: group based (see What is my Team? For Module04 to see your team for this activity) 

**Weight:** 4% 

==highlighted phrases== indicate places which are links to other documents (links will become active within 24 hours of this document's release)

**Objectives**

- to develop skills in the real-life application of theoretical concepts from ==R-Design-V==, prototyping

#### Instructions

1. read through the activity description
2. read the activity expectations: deliverables and grading expectations
3. then (AND ONLY THEN) begin the activity

#### Activity Description

First, the members of the sub-pod should introduce themselves to one another, if they haven't already met.  You will be working as team members on this activity.

The team will be creating a basic prototype of "get to know us" interactive media instance.  We are calling this an instance of interactive media since it is so basic that it is not quite an app.

You will create one variants of the prototype: for a desktop.  Later, we will create prototypes for other platforms.

- The activity has one components that each team member needs to be complete individually
- The activity then requires a components to be completed collaboratively

When you get together as a team during the class breakout session, you should read the instructions together, come up with a plan, and start getting work done.

#### Getting Set up

1. Go to https://www.figma.com/ and sign up free account using your York University email account (if you don't already have an account set up)
2. Once you create your Figma account, you should apply to obtain the free Educational Version, which allows unlimited projects and editors. (To facilitate this, it is strongly suggested that you sign up for your account with your York University email account.)  See more information here in section 4 of https://www.figma.com/pricing-faq/
   To apply for educational status, see here: https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041061214

You can start working on your individual components even without the educational account.

But to complete the activity and to produce the deliverable for submission, at least one person on your  team will need to set up an **Educational Team** in Figma for your project team's work.

#### Learning Figma

Figma is quite intuitive and many students can figure it out through using it.  There is a on-line course that you can follow:

View the following sections from the  =="Figma for UX Design" Course Information==(be sure to read the Viewing Notes)

- Section 1: 1.1 - 1.4 (optional 1.5)
- Section 2: 2.1-2.2, 2.6-2.10 (optional 2.3-2.5)
- Section 3: 3.1-3.2
- Section 4: 4.1-4.2 (optional 4.3)
- Section 5: 5.1-5.4

#### Creating Your First Prototypes in Figma

- First, ensure you install local fonts as per Section (1.3) "Setting up local fonts" in the =="Figma for UX Design" Course Information==
- You will have one (or possible more) teams set up.  
- Within a team, Create a new project to hold the materials for this activity, call it   other work in the course "3461f21 coursework"
- Create a new file called  `Mod04_Y_PodZZ_Figma`
  - The `Y` in the name will be your pod's section number (either  `A` or  `B` )
  - The `ZZ` in the name will be your sub-pod's identifier (e.g., `A1`, `A2`, `B1`, ...) 
- Obtain the "Lo-fi wireframe Kit" by Dave Whitley 
  - look under  "Community" in the File Browser view, locate the "Lo-fi wireframe Kit"  by Dave Whitley and download it. Move it into your project. 
- Follow the instructions under the frame "Use it as a starter file"

#### Your Individual Component

##### Personal Overview:  

- create a page called "Desktop Variant"

- each team member creates a frame (Use the 'Desktop' frame template 1440x1024), rename the frame to be the team member's own name

- - there should be one frame for each team member

- for this task, make use the components from "❖ Components" from the "Lo-fi wireframe Kit" 

- select and use the component in order to make your frame appear to be a browser window

- each person's frame should contain the following:

- - navigation controls (see below)
  - the person's "Personal Overview" (see below)

##### Personal Overview:  

The personal overview should contain:

- the person's preferred name and pronouns
- an “illustration element”, which can be a photo, a graphic, a  line drawing, an illustration, an emoji, a meme, whatever is desired and personally chosen by the group member (not text)    
- a “tidbit of information”, you can re-use the “two truths and a lie” info from earlier in the course or use something else
- you are not restricted to use only the components from "❖ Components" from the "Lo-fi wireframe Kit"

##### Navigation Controls

- the choice of navigational controls is up to the team (e.g., buttons, dropdowns, tabs, hyperlinks)
- use the components from "❖ Components" from the "Lo-fi wireframe Kit"
- must afford the possibility to reach the frames of *any* of the other team members

#### Putting the Pieces Together: The Group Submission

- one team member needs to set up an **Educational Team** in Figma for your project team's work
- the team needs to create a landing frame and designate it to be the starting frame
- each team member adds their individual page to the team project
- each team member add prototype actions to the navigation controls ('navigate to')
- test-drive your prototype to ensure that the user can navigate to each team member's frame

a sample of a (sub-par) submission product can be found here: https://www.figma.com/proto/Pr1VLUWNGewnCuMajIryLz/Sprint-07-Figma-Activity?node-id=1%3A5650&scaling=min-zoom

#### Deliverable #1: Figma File

- Select the option under File -> Save local copy..

  save the file locally `Mod04_Y_PodZZ_Figma.fig`

- submit this *.fig file under the submission module ==Mod04: Group Figma Activity==

#### Submission and Grading Notes

- the submission will be made on behalf of the **team**
- any member of the team may make the submission (it will be registered under all pod members names)
- the team may submit revised submission up until the submission cut-off date; a new submission will overwrite the prior submission
- the grade will be derived from the application of the grading rubric
- all team members will receive the grade
- any team member who is flagged as a non-contributor through the ==Module04 Team Dynamic Followup== will have their grade removed and replaced with "not submitted" 



#### Expectations

The submissions will be assessed using the 4-point scale (Below expectations, Marginally meets expectations, Meets expectations, Exceeds expectations), except where noted otherwise.

To meet expectations:

1. The submission adheres to the specification (e.g., file name and file format are correct, etc) *this is a binary assessment, yes/no*
2. Completeness: all specified elements are present
3. Design Principle of Consistency: *meets expectations* means that the principle of consistency has been followed
4. Flair: good level of creativity demonstrated for the personal components
5. Calibre of Presentation: *meets expectations* means that the overall calibre of presentation is good.  This refers to both the elements of graphic design and the elements of written communication (copy is well written, in English without errors of grammar, spelling, text is cohesive, text is coherent, clear and concise).

#### What to Submit

The submission consists of 1 files.  Ensure they it is named correctly.

1. Exported Figma file: `Mod04_Y_PodZZ_Figma.fig`
