### Mod04: Individual Figma Activity Specification

**Format**: individual

**Weight:** 2% 

These ==highlighted phrases== indicate places which are links to other documents (if not already active, links will become active within 24 hours of this document's release).

**Objectives**

- to develop skills in the real-life application of theoretical concepts from ==R-Design-V==, prototyping
- to build familiarity with the basic functionality of Figma

#### Instructions

1. read through the activity description
2. read the activity expectations: deliverables and grading expectations
3. then (AND ONLY THEN) begin the activity

#### Activity Description

You will complete two basic variants of one screen of a prototype app. The activity is designed primarily to build skills in manipulating components with a frame, via resizing and rearranging.   

This activity assumes that you have your Figma account already set up, as per the requirements of the Mod04: Group Figma Activity.   If you do not have your educational Figma account already set up, with local fonts and with the "Lo-fi wireframe Kit" installed, then go back to that activity specification and undertake those steps before starting here. Consult the  =="Figma for UX Design" Course Information== resource as needed.

#### Getting Set up

1. It is assumed you have your own personal 'team' (you are the only member), and this is separate from any 'group' team you set up for the Mod04 Group Figma Activity.  
2. At the end of this step, you need to have a project set up that contains a design file.  You need to have the "Web app" example  from the "Lo-fi wireframe Kit" copied into your design file.  You can do this two ways
   1. First Approach: Create a new design file in your project and then copy what is needed into the new project (see below).
   2. Second Approach:  Take the whole "Lo-fi wireframe Kit" design file and move it into your project.  Then you can rename the design file, add and delete pages from it, etc. (see below).
3. Your task is to take the "Web app"  example" from the "Lo-fi wireframe Kit", which has dimension 443x911, and then reinstantiate it as two new variants, one for each of your two new frames (as set up in step 1). 
   1. **In each of the two new variants, you should have the same elements (buttons, tabs, nav controls, etc - all widgets).  But these elements will not fit in the new dimensions.  So....** Resize and rearrange the elements as needs to maintain the interface components and its overall look and feel, but make use of the new screen dimensions.  
   2. Use your judgement in doing the resizing/repositioning.
   3. Modify each variant by changing the highlighted elements.  **(In the example, the current element that is highlighted in blue is "Days" and "Visitors 101".)** Your two variants should have different highlighting from each other.  Both should have different highlighting than the initial version of the example. 

##### First Approach 

1. Under your own personal team, create a new project called  `Mod04_Figma_XXXXXX`, where `XXXXXX` corresponds to your family name.  Example,  `Mod04_Figma_Baljko` .  
2. In that project, create a new design file (you can name it however you like).
3. With your design file, you will have one page created by default.  You can use that page or create a new  page, whichever you like.  Within the page, create two new frames:  a frame for an iPad mini (768x1024) and a frame for an Android handset (360x640), the other for 
4. Duplicate the "Lo-fi wireframe Kit" from the community so that you have a copy in your "Drafts" section.
5. Locate the example that is provided in the "Lo-fi wireframe Kit", the one in the "Examples" page, in the frame labelled "Web app".  There is component labelled "Android" on that frame.   The example is also shown as an image at the bottom of this file.  It has dimensions 443x911 (and so, despite being labelled Android, it does not have that aspect ratio).
6. Copy all of the components from the example and paste them into your own design file.

##### Second Approach 

1. Duplicate the "Lo-fi wireframe Kit" from the community so that you have a copy in your "Drafts" section.
2. Drag the duplicated design file from Drafts into your project.
3. Your project will now have this design file added to it. You can now rename the design file, add and delete pages from it, etc.



#### Deliverable #1: PDF Export

- Select the option under File -> Export to PDF

  a  file will be created with the name  `Mod04_Figma_XXXXXX.pdf`

  **the file should have exactly two pages**

- submit this *.pdf file under the submission module ==Mod04: Individual Figma Activity==

#### Submission and Grading Notes

- the submission is individual, it is your responsibility to be follow academic honesty. 
- you may submit and resubmit revised submission up until the submission cut-off date; a new submission will overwrite the prior submission
- the grade will be derived from the application of the grading rubric

#### Expectations

The submissions will be assessed using the 4-point scale (Below expectations, Marginally meets expectations, Meets expectations, Exceeds expectations), except where noted otherwise.

To meet expectations:

1. The submission adheres to the specification (e.g., file name and file format are correct, etc) *this is a binary assessment, yes/no*
2. Completeness, Frame 1: all specified elements are present
3. Completeness, Frame 2: all specified elements are present
4. Recalibration, Frame 1: the components have been resized/repositioned in order to make effective use of the available real estate, display bounds are respected
5. Recalibration, Frame 2: the components have been resized/repositioned in order to make effective use of the available real estate, display bounds are respected
6. Highlighting, Frame 1: the highlighting requirement has been implemented as specified
7. Highlighting, Frame 2: the highlighting requirement has been implemented as specified

#### What to Submit

The submission consists of 1 files.  Ensure they it is named correctly.

1. Exported Figma file: `Mod04_Figma_XXXXXX.pdf`
