#### Description

Now you have seen the passenger and driver journeys for the YuRide app, having completed ==Mod08: YURide App Prototyping Activity== 

In this activity, you will use the SCAMPER technique to spark new ideas using YuRide as a starting point.  These ideas could, with further development, be the core of the idea of an interactive app that serves as a companion, spin-off or extensions to YuRide.   For each of the 7 SCAMPER probes, you are expected to produce at least 3 responses with a good level of creativity.

Use a miro board to contain the brainstorming ideas.

#### Deliverable #1: Completed SCAMPER Exercise 

- Prepare a visually appealing illustration of the results of the SCAMPER exercise
- It is up to you to organize the materials in a reasonable ways
- Ensure the illustration has a title, ensure that your own name is listed
- Ensure that the smallest font size is 12 pt.
- name the Miro board using the following format:  `Mod07_XXXX_RideSharingIdeation`
  - The `XXXX` in the name will be your own family name

#### Expectations

The submissions will be assessed using the 4-point scale (Below expectations, Marginally meets expectations, Meets expectations, Exceeds expectations), except where noted otherwise.

To meet expectations:

1. The submission adheres to the specification (e.g., file name and file format are correct, etc) *this is a binary assessment, yes/no*
2. Completeness: all specified elements are present
3. Suitability: *meets expectations* means the responses under each of the 7 SCAMPER 'probes' fit the nature of the question 
4. Innovation: good level of creativity demonstrated for each of the 7 SCAMPER 'probes' [weight: 2]
5. Calibre of Presentation: *meets expectations* means that the overall calibre of presentation is good.  This refers to both the elements of graphic design and the elements of written communication (copy is well written, in English without errors of grammar, spelling, text is cohesive, text is coherent, clear and concise).

To achieve 'Exceeds expectations', the submission needs to exceed and go beyond meeting expectations.



#### What to Submit

The submission consists of 1 file.  Ensure it is named correctly.
