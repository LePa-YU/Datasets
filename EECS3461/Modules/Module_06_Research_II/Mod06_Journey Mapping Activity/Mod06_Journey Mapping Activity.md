#### Activity Description

In this activity, your team will create **journey maps** for two **goal-focused experiences**. 

Your team will complete the following two activity components: (i) internal investigation, (ii) journey map formulation.  The output of Component (i) "internal investigation" is "raw" interview data (text-based document). The output of Component (ii) "hypothesis visualization" is a journey map (Miro board).

Full journey mapping is a much larger undertaking than what we will be doing in this activity. The two components (i) and (ii) described below are a subset of the work involved in a full journey map activity.  In the place of using generalized user scenario and personas, you will mapping out the actual experiences of known actors.

##### Scope of this Activity

In this activity, you will be tasked with mapping out experiences in a particular domain of human activity:  **the experience of York students getting themselves to the Keele campus** (to attend class or other activity).  We are just now more fully resuming in-person activities on campus, so this domain is contemporary and relevant.  There are many different students at York, and much diversity in how students get themselves onto campus.  You will be mapping out the experiences of your own team members.  The teams in the course vary in terms of their members, so its important that we do not make any incorrect initial assumptions about the students in the team.

A person's own experiences in **getting themselves to the Keele campus** is not likely to stay the same over all of the time they are a York student (e.g., from the start of a degree program up to the present moment). In fact, recently, for a solid chunk of months (like 17-19 months or so), you might not have come onto campus at all. 

The experiences of the members of your team are expected to vary in terms of several factors, such as: 

- living arrangement (e.g., on- or off-campus), 
- mode of transportation (e.g., walking, cycling, public transportation, car pooling or ride share, commuting by car, etc), 
- other factors such as cost considerations and scheduling considerations (e.g.m coordinating car use with family members, managing multiple destinations such as campus and place of employment, etc).    

Some experiences get be repeated many times (e.g., the way you got to campus every day for many days, an entire term, or even longer).   Other experiences may only be a one-time or very occassional (e.g., it is very expensive to take a cab, but once you had to do it in order to not miss a final exam).  We will call an experience "**common**" if it happened repeatedly (let's say something like 20 times within a single academic term).   We will capture these common experiences as **scenarios**.

It is very possible in a single 3-person team that there will be many different types of experiences.  It is also theorectically possible, but extremely unlikely, that all people on the team will have a one and only  experience in common.  What is common among all the team members is this following: motivations &#8594; goals (**GET TO CAMPUS** + other goals) &#8594; activities &#8594; tasks &#8594; operations (to use Norman's hierarchy).   The assumption being made here is that there is a reasonable set of 2-5 "common" scenarios within each team. 

##### Purpose of this Mapping Activity

This mapping activity is one mode of conducting research.  The immediate purpose of this activity to conduct research into a particular domain of human activity.  The goal of the research is to feed into an interative design process focused on identifying opportunities to improve the way students get on campus, which may or may not involve the use of an interactive system (in which case the "student" could be instead called the "user").  We will come back to the broader design process in other course activities, but for now, this activity is focused on conducting user research.

#### Component (i): Internal Investigation

Your team will investigate and report on two different scenarios, which we will denote  **Scenario A** and **Scenario B**. Each scenario must be a "common" experience of getting to campus for at least one team member (but ideally more than one team member).  If the experience is common to more than one team member, build an amalgam of the experience. 

Your team will compile the following 5 parts (repeat for each of Scenario A and Scenario B).  

The internal investigation for each scenario should be written up in its own document.  The team should compose a list of questions, and then use the questions to elicit the content below. The internal investigation can be completed via team discussion, with one team member "interviewing" the others.

##### Component (i), Part I: Actor Component

See ==R-Design-VI== (Personas) for the background info on these components.

1. Identification of Actor(s): name and age of team member(s), with a picture 
2. Tag line to capture the "essence" of the actor(s), consisting of two or three words (e.g., in one case, the tagline is "Jumping Jamie" to correspond to the actor "Jamie".  The tag line meant to paint a quick picture of the actor).  
3. Degree of intensity with the scenario being captured:  describe how frequent and the pattern (e.g., daily, twice a week, once the weather gets cold, only when the weather is warm, etc).
4. Context of the scenario: describe the overall context of the scenario that is described below (e.g., is the scenario taken by choice? what other constraints or considerations are at play)
5. Expectations (the goals and concerns in the scenario): what are the major considerations for the actor(s)? e.g., speed, predicatability, flexibility, cost, comfort, safety, and any other considerations/expectations that may factor into the scenario
6. Representative quote: something that sums up the attitude of the actor (e.g., "necessity is the mother of invention", "Better to take longer than to be uncomfortable", etc)

##### Component (i), Part II: Scenario Description

Description of the way the actor gets to campus, enumerated as a sequence of actions (tasks and operations that are actual behaviours undertaken by the actor).

##### Component (i), Part III: Phases

Divide the actions from Part II above into coherent "phases", which should correspond to stages.

Here are some examples from https://www.nngroup.com/articles/journey-mapping-101/:

- For an ecommerce scenario (like buying Bluetooth speakers), the stages can be discover, try, buy, use, seek support.
- For a big (or luxury) purchases (like  test driving and buying a car), the stages can be engagement, education, research, evaluation, justification.
- For a business-to-business scenario (like rolling out an internal tool), the stages could be purchase, adoption,  retention, expansion, advocacy.

  Use these examples as a model to generate phases that make sense for the scenario.

##### Component (i), Part IV: Mindsets and Emotions

For each of the stages identified in Part III above, list the following:

- **Mindsets**: the thoughts, questions, motivations, and information needs that the actor has at that phase.
- **Emotions**: provide the contextual layer of emotion for the actor (e.g., being contented, frustrated, concerned, etc), with a focus on the valence of the emotional context (e.g., “ups” and “downs” of the experience)

##### Component (i), Part V: Opportunities, Metrics, Ownership

For the scenario:

- identify at least 3 opportunities for improvement.  Each opportunity needs to be linked to a specific phase.
- identify the metrics that are relevant to the actor and the scenario.  Link back Component(1), Part 1, bullet  item 5.  For instance, if minimizing travel time is a concern for the actor, then the metric would be duration of travel.  Or if personal safety is a concern, then the metric would be degree to which travel avoids safety risk. 
- identify the entities that "own" the components upon which the scenario depends (e.g., who would need to be involved if the opportunity for improvement were to be actioned?)

#### Component (ii): Journey Map Formulation

In this component, the team builds a journey map for the two scenarios.

Each journey map is developed using the content from Component (i).

Create a representation in Miro.  You can base your representation on the template provided here: https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2020/07/30/nng-cjm.png.  You can modify the template to better suit the information derived from Component (i).

The following components from Component (i) are required to be included on the journey map (see also ==R-Design-VII== for more detail). 

- Component (i), Part I.  In the template, notice that items #1 and #2 appear in the top left-hand corner. Notice that #3 and #4 get merged into a written description under the heading "**Scenario:**".  #5 appears in its own section. #6 does not appear in the template and can be optionally included.   You can follow the template or devise a different mode of presentation.
- Component (i), Part III.  In the template, notice that this is depicted graphically as a row of rectangular regions. Each rectangular region represents a phase.  The bullet points from Part II appear within the phases.
- Component (i), Part IV.  .  In the template, notice that this is depicted as a graphical overlay on the phases
- Component (i), Part V. In the template, notice that this appears in text summary format at the bottom of the visualization.

- select 'Export this board', and 'Save as image'
- ensure the export region (shown as a white overlay) captures entirety of the illustration (drag the corner handles to reposition the export region)
- select the 'Large' option (the pixel dimensions will vary according to the size of the export region)
- the exported image will be downloaded locally (filename will be based on the miro board name)

#### Expectations

The submissions will be assessed using the 4-point scale (Below expectations, Marginally meets expectations, Meets expectations, Exceeds expectations), except where noted otherwise.

To meet expectations:

1. The submission adheres to the specification (e.g., file name and file format are correct, etc) *this is a binary assessment, yes/no*
2. Component (i), Completeness: all specified elements are present
3. Component (i), Innovation/Calibre: good level of insight and analysis demonstrated for each of the elements
4. Component (i), Calibre of Presentation: *meets expectations* means that the overall calibre of presentation is good.  This refers to both the elements of graphic design and the elements of written communication (copy is well written, in English without errors of grammar, spelling, text is cohesive, text is coherent, clear and concise).
4. Component (ii), Completeness: all specified elements are present
6. Component (iJourni), Innovation/Calibre: good level of insight and analysis demonstrated for each of the elements
7. Component (ii), Calibre of Presentation: *meets expectations* means that the overall calibre of presentation is good.  This refers to both the elements of graphic design and the elements of written communication (copy is well written, in English without errors of grammar, spelling, text is cohesive, text is coherent, clear and concise).

To achieve 'Exceeds expectations', the submission needs to exceed and go beyond meeting expectations.
