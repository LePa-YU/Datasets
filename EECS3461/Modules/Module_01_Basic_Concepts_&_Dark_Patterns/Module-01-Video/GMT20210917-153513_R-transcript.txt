SPEAKER 2
Okay, so welcome everyone. This is class meeting three for um 34 60 one. We're in the middle of module one, Which is three

SPEAKER 1
class meetings. And we're in the 2nd of three class meetings.

SPEAKER 2
Our final class Meeting for Module one will be on

SPEAKER 1
Monday and we have an action packed time together and

SPEAKER 2
in order to fit everything in. I we just did this on Wednesday. I had to talk really, really fast and I know it's fast, but just rest assured the recordings will be

SPEAKER 1
posted. And the recordings from Wednesday are also available to section B students as well. So between the two, I hope you get what you need. So, let's look here, intellectual property rights.

SPEAKER 2
We have an agenda for this class meeting now before we hit record, we took care of a few housekeeping

SPEAKER 1
items, students joining the course and so on. So that didn't get captured. But let's continue. So calendar review, Discuss one Resource Packed.

SPEAKER 2
The First Resource Pack for Design. Design work is teamwork. The second design resource pack is dark patterns designed to some brief comments about social media is a data source and then break out rooms.

SPEAKER 1
And the purpose of the breakout room is for your

SPEAKER 2
pod to have some protected meeting time to get work done on the dark pattern analysis activity, ideally this will be 40 minutes. So that means that let me just do the timing. We're aiming to be done here at uh 11, sorry,

SPEAKER 1
1245, So we're hoping to break out by 1205.

SPEAKER 2
So that means that we have 25 minutes to cover

SPEAKER 1
all of this. I don't think it's realistic. Probably it's going to take, I don't know, 1/2 an hour to 40 minutes. So the 40 minutes probably will be truncated to 30

SPEAKER 2
minutes. Uh we will give time on monday as well for pods to continue working on the dark pattern analysis activity and that's not due until Tuesday evening. So to start, let's do the calendar review and for this where my mouse.

SPEAKER 1
Okay, so this is a start of each module where

SPEAKER 2
I like to shoot walk through the course calendar from the viewpoint of the student. So I'm logged into a, I should be logged into

SPEAKER 1
the class in my fake student role. I don't know what the heck this is legit. This is so strange. Let's fix this. Yeah, it's so weird. Okay, bear with me. So I'm no longer a student here.

SPEAKER 2
You see, sorry, I lost my credentials.

SPEAKER 1
So let's go into the course.

SPEAKER 2
I'm going to pretend I'm a student now. And the main point, what I want to do is just reinforce something many of you already do this, but some of you maybe are not familiar. So we're just going to take a moment under calendar here in this left drawer. See remember the design pattern we talked about. There's a calendar option and this is a good place for you to go and see what's going on in

SPEAKER 1
the course and we can see that here we are

SPEAKER 2
today. We're having our class meeting and we have the dark pattern activity due on Tuesday midnight one minute before midnight. So that's what we're focusing on right now. Now if someone did raise in the discord channel that the independent activity that is supposed to be doing sunday

SPEAKER 1
isn't posted yet.

SPEAKER 2
It is true. And that's my mistake.

SPEAKER 1
I didn't post it. So I'm going to consult with Mana, the co instructor afterwards to figure out what to do about this because obviously it's not really fair or equitable to launch a thing to you and like ask you to do it

SPEAKER 0
in one day.

SPEAKER 1
So we're going to do some kind of adjustment about this. So let's just set that aside for now. I think you'll see that we're fair and reasonable about things.

SPEAKER 2
And also just to remind you that there's a little quiz at the end of this module and it's going to open on Tuesday and it's going to close right before the section a class on Wednesday as well. There's going to be a small reflection piece uh at

SPEAKER 1
the end of this module.

SPEAKER 2
So, this course, as you see, has a lot of little things and you know, the heuristic is roughly one

SPEAKER 0
Hour of work for 1%.

SPEAKER 1
So let's wrap this up. So please keep an eye on the calendar.

SPEAKER 2
It keeps track of everything that you need to do it. Flags all of the activities that you can complete yourself.

SPEAKER 1
Not all of these things are submissions. So like there's a lot of things do hear that a lot of things flagged on monday that looks overwhelming.

SPEAKER 2
If you find this view not really helpful, you can

SPEAKER 1
switch to the upcoming events and you can see everything listed in this form. Okay. So let's go back to our agenda.

SPEAKER 2
So the next thing we're going to do is discuss

SPEAKER 1
the resource pack, design work, his team work.

SPEAKER 2
And this is important because we're going to go in

SPEAKER 0
the breakout room and you're going to start to do

SPEAKER 1
work together as a group.

SPEAKER 2
We're ramping up to the smaller group work, but we're

SPEAKER 1
starting in this large group format.

SPEAKER 2
So I'm going to switch now. So I'm going to stop the recording and we're going

SPEAKER 1
to record each of these things separately and then we'll

SPEAKER 2
come back and we'll talk about the breakout rooms and

SPEAKER 1
then we'll get that organized. Okay, so I'm going to stop the recording now.
