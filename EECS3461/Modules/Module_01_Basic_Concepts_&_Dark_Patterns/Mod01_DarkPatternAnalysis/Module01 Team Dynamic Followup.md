#### Module01 Team Dynamic Followup

This document describe the process that will be followed to assess the team dynamics.

After the deadline for ==Mod01: Dark Pattern Analysis Activity== has passed, a feedback module will be opened up.

The feedback module can be used to flag pod members as `Non-contributor` or  `Potential Issue` .

- `Non-contributor`: a pod member who does not attend any pod meetings, does not do any work, and makes no effort to connect with the pod

- `Potential Issue`: a pod member who has completed work, but did it poorly and/or not on-time

The submission will not be anonymous, but it will be private to the Teaching Team (other members of the  class will not see). The Teaching Team will decide on the next steps.
