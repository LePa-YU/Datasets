### Mod01: Dark Pattern Analysis Activity Specification

**Format**: group based (Module 01 Learning Pods)

**Weight:** 3% 

**Objectives**

- build capacity within learning pods for collaboration (this capacity will translate into groupwork done in smaller teams)
- build understanding of dark patterns, build understanding of the characteristics of dark patterns
- build understanding of interactive system *platforms* and  *postures*
- analyze examples of interactive systems with respect to criteria of platform, posture and design pattern

#### What to Do

##### Step 1: Set up Project Management

- Refer to the document ==Project Management in EECS3461: Pod Activities==
- Upon completion of this step, the project manager role will be established and the next work pieces

##### Step 2: Obtain your pod's dataset of design examples

- each pod is provided with a dataset of 'design examples' (each reddit post is assumed to contain one example of design)
- locate your pod's dataset on eClass under ==Mod01: Dark Pattern Datasets==
- be sure to obtain the correct dataset

##### Other Steps (Sequence and Method to be determined by the pod): 



##### Dataset Coding

- the dataset has a set of columns for each design example:
  - `Sneaking` (`SNEAK`)
  - `Urgency ` (`URGENCY`)
  - `Misdirection` (`MISDIR`)
  - `Social Proof`  (`SOC_PRF`)
  - `Scarcity` (`SCARC`)
  - `Obstruction` (`OBSTR`)
  - `Forced Action` (`FORC_ACT`)
  - `Dark Pattern not applicable`  (`DP_NA`)
  - `not able to determine` (`NATD`)
  - `Coding Comments` 
- for each design example, code each design example by placing the character `x` in the corresponding column. If a judgment call is needed, add a note to explain under `Coding Comments` 
- only one `x` per row
- the only changes allowed to the spreadsheet are as follows: 
  - (i) adding `x` in the coding columns
  - (ii) adding plain text to the `Coding Comments` column
  - (iii) adding additional worksheets as needed to support the group work
- **do not change** the the spreadsheet in any other way
  - **do not** change the set up of the spreadsheet (the position of the worksheet from the first position)
  - **do not** add rows or columns
  - **do not** change the content of the cells containing the data 
  - **do not** change the name of the worksheet
- the coding is complete once all examples have been coded
- the quality of the coding is determined by the strength of the evidence for the coding assignment; any coding notes can be added in the `Coding Comments` field for the design example
- NEW!  The dataset may contain duplicate rows.  Unfortunately, this is bad data (as retrieved by the scraper).  Code the duplicate rows according to the categories above and flag the duplicate in the  `Coding Comments` column.  Ensure that duplicates are coded consistently.

***FILENAMING***

- the format for the file should be unchanged: excel  (`.xlsx`)
- The file retains the name:  `SecX_PodY_DatasetZ.xlsx`
  - The `X` in the filename will be your pod's section number (either  `A` or  `B` )
  - The `Y` in the filename will be your pod's identifier (e.g., `A`, `B`, `C`, ...) 
  - The `Z` will be the dataset identifier, DO NOT CHANGE IT



##### Gallery of Examples

- prepare a document that contains 7 sections, one section for each dark pattern type
- in each section, provide a list of the examples (list the example identifier)
- select the most illustrative example from the list of examples (e.g., an example that could be used for teaching purposes)  
- NEW! If the dataset did not contain **any** examples  of a particular Dark Pattern type, then you should state that the list is empty; there will be no example for that Dark Pattern Type's section. 
- the title of the document is "Gallery of Examples"
- do not add a header page, the pod member names, or other information like this (all of this information is already connected with the submission)
- try to make the document as compact as possible but not at the expense of legibility (e.g., use small margins, eliminate unnecessary whitespace)

***FILENAMING***

- the format for the file should be one of: word doc (`.docx`), rich text file (`.rtf`) or markdown (`.md`) 
- The filename must be:   `SecX_PodY_GalleryZ.docx`  (other variants permitted: `SecX_PodY_GalleryZ.md`, `SecX_PodY_GalleryZ.rtf`)
  - Replace the `X` in the filename will be  your pod's section number (either  `A` or  `B` )
  - Replace the `Y` with your pods identifier (e.g., `A`, `B`, `C`, ...) 
  - The `Z` will be the dataset identifier, ensure it matches the coded dataset identifier



##### Teamwork Notes

- prepare a short document that describes how the work was undertaken
- the format is up to the team, be sure to discuss
  - how did the group identifying the work to be done?
  - how did the group dividing up the work?
  - how did the group checking the work?
  - how did the group get the files correctly prepared and submitted on time?

***FILENAMING***

- the format for the file should be one of: word doc (`.docx`), rich text file (`.rtf`) or markdown (`.md`) 
- Name the file:  `SecX_PodY_TeamworkNotes.docx` (other variants permitted: `SecX_PodY_TeamworkNotes.md`, `SecX_PodY_TeamworkNotes.rtf`)
  - Replace the `X` in the filename with your pod's section number (either  `A` or  `B` )
  - Replace the `Y` with your pods identifier (e.g., `A`, `B`, `C`, ...) 



#### Submission and Grading Notes

- the submission will be made on behalf of the **entire learning pod**
- any member of the pod may make the submission
- the pod may submit revised submission up until the submission cut-off date; a new submission will overwrite the prior submission
- the grade will be derived from the application of the grading rubric
- all pod members will receive the grade
- any pod member who is flagged as a non-contributor through the ==Module01 Team Dynamic Followup== will have their grade removed and replaced with "not submitted" 
- "good" calibre of presentation for a writing: answers are well written, in English without errors of grammar, spelling, text is  cohesive, text is coherent, clear and concise

#### Expectations

The groups submission will be assessed using the 4-point scale (Below expectations, Marginally meets expectations,Meets expectations,Exceeds expectations), except where noted otherwise.

To meet expectations:

1. The submission adheres to the specification (e.g., file names are correct, files in specified format, etc) *this is a binary assessment, yes/no*
2. The coding is complete
3. The coding is of reasonable quality
4. The Gallery of Examples has presentation of a good calibre
5. The Gallery of Examples is complete (contains all required elements)
6. The Gallery of Examples has good content (the examples are illustrative)
7. The Teamwork Notes has presentation of a good calibre 
8. The Teamwork Notes are complete (contains all required elements)

#### What to Submit

The submission consists of 3 files.  Ensure they are named correctly.

1. Coded data set: `SecX_PodY_DatasetZ.xlsx`
2. Gallery of Examples: `SecX_PodY_Gallery.docx`  (other variants permitted: `SecX_PodY_Gallery.md`, `SecX_PodY_Gallery.rtf`)
3. Teamwork Notes: `SecX_PodY_TeamworkNotes.docx`  (other variants permitted: `SecX_PodY_TeamworkNotes.md`, `SecX_PodY_TeamworkNotes.rtf`)
