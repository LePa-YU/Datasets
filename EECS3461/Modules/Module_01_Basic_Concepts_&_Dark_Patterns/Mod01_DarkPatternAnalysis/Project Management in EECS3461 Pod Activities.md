### Project Management in EECS3461: Pod Activities

- learning pods are large 12-13 people, which makes for a large team
- it can be difficult to establish good team dynamics with such a large group
- for smaller group activities, we will use **team contracts**, but for pod activities, we wonâ€™t use team contracts
- pod-based activities are clearly defined and have a narrow scope
- pod-based activities are designed to be easy to divvy up
- we will treat the pod-based activities as a ramp-up for smaller teamwork

#### Guidance and Approach

- Each pod member will review and be familiar with the team work resource pack, R-Design-I

- It is assumed (without a signed contract) that each pod member is committed to the 5 competencies: Commitment, Communication, Capabilities, Standards, and Focus
- Time will be given in CM03 for learning pods to have their initial meeting
- The pod members should consult the section below, "Guidance For Mod01: Dark Pattern Analysis Activity"
- At the initial meeting, the pod members will get to know one another and start the work.
- Time will be given in CM04 for learning pods to have a second meeting
- If any pod member is absent from class, it is that pod member's responsibility to catch up.  Pods should attempt to connect with their other pod members via eClass group chat or the pod's discord channel

#### Guidance For Mod01: Dark Pattern Analysis Activity

- There are three main deliverables: `PodX_TeamworkNotes`, `PodX_Dataset`, `PodX_Gallery`

- The activity is designed to be completed in 2 chunks: 1 chunk (a few hours) to complete the coding, 1 chunk (a few hours)  to prepare the Gallery of Examples; additional time will be needed to coordinate and to have further meetings

- Possible approaches to dividing up the work: 

  - ###### quick, first draft

    - everyone does all  the coding, but as a quick, first-pass draft; the team meets and converges and refines the results
    - everyone creates a quick first pass of the Gallery of Examples, the team meets and converges and refines the draft

  - ###### divide and conquer I: everyone codes and everyone contributes to the Gallery of Examples 

    - divide up the dataset into 12-13 segments, one segment per person; another person each person's work
    - divide up the dataset into 6 segments, one segment per pair, each person checks the other person's work
    - the whole team works on the gallery, or 2 people work on each dark pattern example, or 4 people work on 2 dark pattern examples

  - ###### divide and conquer II: a subset of the team does the  coding, the other team members work on the Gallery of Examples

    - like above, with smaller teams for each of the two main deliverables

  - some other approach not listed here

  - `PodX_TeamworkNotes` is a relative smaller deliverable and can likely be prepared by one pod member

- The pod needs to:

  - decide on an approach and decide on a schedule
  - Aside for the work for the deliverables, there are further issues.  The pod needs to:
    - decide who will assemble the deliverables and ensure the correct formatting? 
    - decide who will double-check the deliverables? 
    - decide who responsible for making the submission on eClass? (if the submission doesn't get made on time, the whole pod loses the grade)
    - who will double-check that the submission gets made?

- The leader will coordinate the work and keep the team on track. Being the leader DOES NOT mean doing all the work.  In fact, the team leader should have a slightly lighter load to offset the time they will spent coordinating within the pod.

  

#### Non-Contributors, Other Issues

Information about pod members who are `Non-contributor` or  `Potential Issue` can be submitted privately via Module01 Team Dynamic Followup.

- `Non-contributor`: a pod member who does not attend any pod meetings, does not do any work, and makes no effort to connect with the pod

- `Potential Issue`: a pod member who has completed work, but did it poorly and/or not on-time
