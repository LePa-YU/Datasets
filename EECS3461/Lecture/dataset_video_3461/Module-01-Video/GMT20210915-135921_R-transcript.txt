SPEAKER 1
Yeah, okay. Mhm. So good morning, everyone Welcome, we're in class meeting three

SPEAKER 2
and this is section A meeting, The class meeting three uh for section B will take place on friday and

SPEAKER 1
um we have a very packed class meeting today with lots of things, so it's nice to see everyone here

SPEAKER 2
and um let's get started. So this slide deck is just providing an overview, but

SPEAKER 0
we're going to be popping in and out of these things and I'm going to record the preamble of the

SPEAKER 1
class and we're gonna let me go to the next

SPEAKER 2
thing, So here's the agenda, we're going to spend just

SPEAKER 0
a few minutes doing a review of the calendar, then

SPEAKER 1
we're going to go to Resource Pack, Our Design one

SPEAKER 0
which is all about teamwork, and we're going to try

SPEAKER 2
and do this quickly, because we're going to use bootstrapping

SPEAKER 1
approach where we'll get started with just some basics, then

SPEAKER 0
you go into your pot and you're going to complete an activity as a team and then we're going to

SPEAKER 1
build on this later, then we're going to discuss the

SPEAKER 2
second resource pack, which is are designed to on dark

SPEAKER 1
patterns and this material.

SPEAKER 2
Exactly not exactly, really strongly builds the foundation for you

SPEAKER 0
to complete the productivity.

SPEAKER 2
Then we're going to come back here and I'm going to share some brief verbal comments about social media as

SPEAKER 0
a data source because that's what we're going to be doing for the activity and then we're going to move into the breakout rooms, so the shorter we spend on

SPEAKER 2
The 1st 4 discussion points, the more time you'll have for the breakout rooms now, um what you're supposed to

SPEAKER 1
be doing in the breakout rooms is discussing your pod approach for the analysis activity. You won't be able to start the analysis activity quite yet because you need the data sets and I'm just

SPEAKER 2
getting them polished and posted. So, but at least there's still important things that have

SPEAKER 0
to be discussed before you even start doing any of the analysis.

SPEAKER 1
So that's our plan. Any questions about the plan? All right. So what I'm going to do now is I'm going

SPEAKER 0
to stop this recording and afterwards in post production.

SPEAKER 1
I'm gonna stitch uh the brief comments about social media

SPEAKER 0
background to this, but now I'm going to stop and

SPEAKER 2
we're going to go to design workers, teamwork.
