Assignment 1 - Variables, expressions, statements
1. Write a python program that will accept the radius of a circle from the user and compute the area

Test using the following values:

r = 1.1, Area = 3.7994
r = 2.2, Area = 15.1976
Note: Formula for Area of a circle: A = Ï€*r2
Note: Use varibles for pi, r and area
Note: For pi, use approximation 3.14
2. Write a python program that asks the user their name. Then print out a line saying name +", what year were you born?". Then ask the user what year they were born. Print the line "You are" + age + "years old."

Example:

Input: What is your name?
Bob
Output: Bob, what year were you born?
1980
Output: You are 40 years old.
Note: You have to first ask the user's name before asking for a year
