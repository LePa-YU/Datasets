Assignment 5 - Data Structures (String/Array)
1. Create a python program that takes an input string from a user. Analyze this string and separate all single letter words into one array, numbers into another array and all longer words into a third array. 
Use functions
The program should continue until the user types in “Exit” or “0” (zero)
Type “Print” to print out the results for the previous input string
Use the given unit tests to check your work
Hint: Use can use tuples to group your answers
Extra practice: Delete all punctuation
2. Create two new unit tests to verify edge cases for your code
