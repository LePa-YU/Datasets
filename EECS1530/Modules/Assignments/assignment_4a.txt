Assignment 4a - Functions
1. Using the math library, create a Python program to calculate the side of a right triangle. Write three (3) functions: 1. SOH, 2. CAH. 3. TOA. 

Create a main() -function
Create 3 functions for calculations
Use user input to specify which side you’re calculating
Ask the user for input angle and side for the calculation
Make continuous until use of “Exit” or “0” when asking for the calculated side

2. Use the given unit tests to test out the solution of the functions created in problem (1). Add two (2) new unit tests to test out the main() function and two (2) new unit tests to test out any of the other functions.

The purpose is to come up with tests that will see if the system will fail. 
If it fails, the program should be modified to make sure passes all tests.
