Assignment 8 - Data Management
1. Write a Python program that takes in seasonal precipitation and temperature data from the provided .csv files. (Look at the data files given. There will be two seasonal files aka have 4 seasons: Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall)

Take these two sets of data and create one data frame called ‘weather’ and remove all rows with empty fields (aka NaN fields)
Calculate the total change of precipitation and save it into a new column called ‘Annual (P)’.
Calculate the total change of temperature and save it into a new column called ‘Annual (T)’.
Save into a new .csv file called ‘seasonal_weather.csv’
2. Write a Python program that takes a snapshot of the data in ‘seasonal_weather.csv’ and saves it into a ‘weather_snapshot.csv’ file.
The snapshot file should be the data from year 1990 to the latest possible year
Add a new column called ‘Pressure’ and fill it with the ALPI pressure data, make sure there are no NaN values
