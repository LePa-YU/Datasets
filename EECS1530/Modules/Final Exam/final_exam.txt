Answer:

You have the following variable: 
a = "An early summer's day"

Write a function called reverse_words(s) which takes a string parameter s which may have a value such as
Don’t switch the    order of words. 
and (for this particular value of s) returns
words. of order the switch Don’t
I.e. the "words" in s are reversed. Words are defined as any sequence of non-space characters, and spaces are the only characters that separate words. The string s may have leading and trailing spaces, and multiple spaces between words. Note that the returned value has just one space between the "words" in the string.
Start of answer:
  def reverse_words(s):

Write a function called grade_points(letter_grade) that returns an integer 0 to 9 corresponding to values of a string parameter letter_grade according to the mapping:
For example, if letter_grade is D+ the value 3 is returned. If letter_grade is not one of F, E, D, D+, C, C+, B, B+, A, or A+ return -1. Use a loop to solve, and also use the variable grades defined below in the start of your answer.
Start of answer:
def grade_points(letter_grade):
   grades = [('A+',9),('A',8),('B+',7),('B',6),('C+',5),('C',4),('D+',3),('D',2),('E',1),('F',0)]

Devise test cases to unit test the insert_sort function, which returns a list of sorted elements constructed by inserting the value y in the correct position of the already sorted list x. (See the test_suite function for example.)
One example test case is given in the code above. Write five additional test cases by specifying values for list1 and list2 and the expected result from the merge_sorted function. Answer using the formatting below. The test case given in the code is shown as an example - obviously this should not be part of your answer!
a. list1 = [2, 9, 14]
   var = 3
   expected result from function == [2,3,9,14]
b. list1 = [ specify values ]
   var = specify value
   expected result from function == [ list values ]
c. list1 = [ specify values ]
   var = specify value
   expected result from function == [ list values ]
d. list1 = [ specify values ]
   var = specify value
   expected result from function == [ list values ]
e. list1 = [ specify values ]
   var = specify value
   expected result from function == [ list values ]

You have a file named april_weather.csv which contains weather data for one month. The format is as follows:
Date,Temperature (C),Precipitation (mm)
01,3,12.3
02,-1,0
There are 30 data points with each one filled in (no empty cells).
a) [4 pts] Add a new column into the .csv file named "Weather". If precipitation is over 0 and the temperature is negative write 'snow'. If precipitation is over 0 and temperature is positive write 'rain'. Otherwise write, 'no rain'.
b) [2 pts] Save the new data into file 'april_weather_2.csv'.
c) [4 pts] Create a scatter plot using the 'april_weather.csv' file. Use date as the x-axis and the temperature as the y-axis.
Note: you can assume that each part of the question is individual and the previous has been done correctly.

a) [3 pts] Write a function date(value) that will add value (i.e. the value input to the function) to today's date and return the future date.
b) [3 pts] Write a function weekday(date) that will get the weekday of the specified input value date.
c) [4 pts] Create a main function where you ask the user to provide a numerical value and use the date() function with the user input. The program will then print the future date and the weekday of that date. The program should continue until a keyword is entered by the user. Make sure that regardless of the user input the program doesn't fail.
Note: The parts can be completed separately. In particular, to write the main function you can assume that the previous parts have been done correctly.
