Delivery Mode
The course will be delivered online for the first few weeks, and then in-person. In either case, there will be no live lectures, except on the first week, which will be dedicated to forming the teams, and introducing the project. On all other weeks, we will use the flipped classroom style. This means that readings/videos and lab tasks will be posted on a weekly basis after the Wednesday meeting time. Students are expected to study the readings/videos, complete the lab task with the help of the TAs on Monday, and be ready to ask questions/discuss the project on the next Wednesday.
All study material and the lab task for the week will be posted under Course Outline (see sidebar).
